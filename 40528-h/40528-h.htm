<p class="nind">may not inaptly be likened to a brother and sister, instead of taking their
places under the usual similitude of "sister countries." They have points
of marked resemblance, in their picturesqueness, their treasures of art, their
associations of history and romance; but, just as the physical aspect of Spain
and its shape upon the map are broader, more thick-set and rugged than the
slender form and flowing curves of Italy, so the Spanish language&mdash;with its
Arabic gutturals interspersed among melodious linguals and vowel sounds&mdash;has
been called the masculine development of that Southern speech of which
the Italian presents the feminine side. The people of both countries exhibit
a similar excitable, ardent quality in their characters; but the national temperament
of the Spaniards is, perhaps, somewhat hardier, more virile, and
sturdier in its passionateness.</p>

<p>It seems to be true that, while the Greek spirit transferred itself to Italy
in the days of Augustus, renewing its influence at the period of the Renaissance,
and leaving upon people and manners an impress never since quite
effaced&mdash;an influence tending toward a certain feminine refinement&mdash;the spirit
of Rome also transferred itself to the subject country, Hispania, and imbued
that region with the strong, austere, or wilful characteristics of purely Latin
civilization, which are still traceable there.</p>

<p>But, however we may account for the phenomena, it is likely that the
mingled contrasts and resemblances of Italy and Spain will more and more
induce travellers to visit the Iberian Peninsula. Italy has now been so thoroughly
depicted in all its larger phases, from the foreigner's point of view,
that investigation must hereafter chiefly be concerned with the study of special
and local features. Spain, on the other hand, offers itself to the general observer
and to the tourist as a field scarcely more explored than Italy was forty
or fifty years ago; and the evidence is abundant that the current of travel is
setting vigorously in this direction. With the extension of a railroad system
and the incursion of sight-seeing strangers in larger number, we must of course
expect that many of the most interesting peculiarities of the people will undergo
modification and at length disappear. This, however, cannot be helped;
and the following chapters, at the same time that they may encourage and aid
those who are destined to bring about such changes, may also serve to arrest
and preserve for future reference the actual appearance of Spain to-day.</p>

<p>Much might be written, with the certainty of an eager audience, concerning
the present political condition of the country, by any one who had had opportunities
for examining it; and Mr. John Hay, a few years ago, gave some
glimpses of it in his charming volume, "Castilian Days." My own brief sojourn
afforded no adequate opportunity for such observation. But it may be
not inadmissible to record here one of the casual remarks which came to my
notice in this connection. On a Mediterranean steamer I met with an exceedingly
bright and healthy man of the middle class, fairly well educated&mdash;one of
those specimens of solid, temperate, active manhood fortunately very common
in Spain, on whom the future of the country really depends&mdash;and, noticing
from my lame speech that I was not a native, he asked me, guardedly, if I was
an Englishman.</p>

<p>"No," I said; "I am an American of the North, of the United States."</p>

<p>His manner changed at once; he thawed: more than that, his face lighted
with hope, as if he had found a powerful friend, and he gazed at me with a
certain delighted awe, attributing to my humble person a glory for which I
was in no way responsible. "You are a republican, then!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He gave me another long, silent look, and then confessed that he, too, was
a firm believer in republicanism.</p>

<p>"Are there many Spaniards now of that party?" I inquired.</p>

<p>His reply showed that he appreciated the difficulties of the national problem.
"Party!" he cried. "Listen: in Spain there is a separate political party
for every man." After a slight pause he added, bitterly, "Sometimes, <i>two</i>!"</p>

<p>It may still be said with a good deal of accuracy, though not of course with
the literalness and the sweeping application that Paul de Saint Victor gave
the words, in speaking of the French Charles II.'s reign, that "Spain no more
changes than the arid zone that encircles a volcano. Kings pass, dynasties
are renewed, events succeed each other, but the foundation remains immobile,
and Philip II. still rules."</p>

<p>I have not attempted to review political matters; and neither have I tried
to give an exhaustive account of the country in any other respect. The pictures
which I have given I have endeavored to make vivid and faithful; and,
if I have succeeded, they will present the essential characteristics of Spain.
What has thus been the object of the text has certainly been attained in the
drawings by Mr. Reinhart, which supply much the greater part of the illustrations
in this volume. Made after sketches from life, which were prepared with
unflagging zeal, and often under great difficulties, they frequently tell more
than language can convey. Their graphic touch, their variety and humor, their
technical merit, give them the best of recommendations; but a word of distinct
recognition is due here to the artist for the fidelity and spirit with which he
has reproduced so many scenes peculiar to the country.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the concluding chapter of "Hints to Travellers" will
prove useful, as supplying certain information not always accessible in guide-books,
and also as condensing the practical particulars of the subject in a convenient
form.</p>

was about to begin.
The scene represented a street
in Burgos, the long-dead capital
of old Castile. Time: night.</p>

<p>Ancient houses on either side
the stage narrow back to an
archway in the centre, opening
through to a pillared walk and
a dimly moonlit space beyond.
Muffled figures occasionally pass
the aperture.</p>

<p>Suddenly enters Don Ramiro&mdash;or Alvar Nuñez, I really don't know
which&mdash;and advances toward the front. To our surprise he does not
open the play with a set speech or any explanation, but continues to
advance until he disappears somewhere under our private box, as if he
were going from this street of the play into some other adjoining street,
just as in actual life. A singular freak of realism! He is closely pursued,
however, by two assassins in long cloaks, who, like all the other
figures we have seen, move noiselessly in soft shoes or canvas sandals.
Presently a shriek resounds from the quarter toward which Don Ramiro
betook himself. Have they succeeded in catching him, and is that the
sound of his mortal agony? We have just concluded that this is the
meaning of the clamor, when, after a second or two, the shriek resolves
itself into laughter. Then we begin to recall that we didn't pay anything
on entering; and, as we glance up toward the folded curtain above<a name="page_002" id="page_002"></a>
the scene, discover that its place is occupied by the starry sky. The
houses, too, have a singularly solid look, and do not appear to be painted.
While all this has been dawning upon us, we become conscious<a name="page_003" id="page_003"></a>
that the mixed sound of agony or mirth just heard was merely the signal
of amusement caused to certain wandering Spaniards by some convulsingly
funny episode; and the next moment their party comes upon
the scene at about the point where the foot-lights ought to be. They
exchange a good-night; some go off, and others thunder at sundry
doors with ancient knockers, awaking mediæval echoes in the dingy
thoroughfares, without causing any great surprise to the neighborhood.</p>

</p>

<p>In truth, we had simply been looking from the window of an inn at
which we had just arrived; but everything had grouped itself in such
a way that it was hard to comprehend that we were not at the theatre.
That day we had been hurled over the Pyrenees, and landed in the dark
at our first Peninsular station; then, facing a crowd of fierce, uncouth
faces at the depôt door, we had somehow got conveyed to the Inn of
the North through narrow, cavernous streets, brightened only by the
feeble light of a few lost lanterns, and so found ourselves staring out
upon our first picturesque night in Spain. The street or plazuela below
us, though now deserted, went on conducting itself in a most melodramatic
manner. Big white curtains hung in front of the iron balconies,
flapping voluminously, or were drawn back to admit the cool night air.
Crickets chirped loudly from hidden crevices of masonry, and a well-contrived
bat sailed blindly over the roofs in the penumbral air, through
which the moon was slowly rising. Lights went in and out; some one
was seen cooking a late supper in one dwelling; windows were opened
and shut, and a general appearance of haunting ghosts was kept up.
Now and then a woman came to the balcony and chatted with unseen
neighbors across the way about the festival of the morrow. By-and-by
one side of the street blew its lamps out and prepared for bed; but the
wakeful side insisted on talking to the sleepy one for some time longer,
until warned by the cry of the night-watch that midnight had come.
Anything more desolate and peculiar than this cry I have never heard.
It was a long-drawn, melancholy sounding of the hour, with a final
"All's well!" terminating in a minor cadence which seemed to drop the
voice back at once into the Middle Ages. This same chant may have
resounded from the days of Lain Calvo and the old judges of Castile
unaltered, and for a time it made me fancy that the little Gothic town
had returned to its musty youth. We were walled into a sleepy feudal
stronghold once more, and perhaps at that very moment the Cid was
celebrating his nuptials with Ximena, daughter of the count he had
murdered for an insult, in the old ruined citadel up there on the hill,
above the cathedral spires. But the watchman came and went, and the<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a>
present resumed its sway. He passed with slow step, in a big cloak
and queer cap, carrying a long bladed staff, and a lantern which cast<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a>
swaying squares of light around his feet; silent as a black ghost, and
seeming to have been called into life only with the lighting of his lamp-wick.
But, after he had disappeared, the lonely quaver of his cry returned
to us from farther and farther away, penetrating into the comfortless
apartment to which we now retired for sleep.</p>

<br />
<span class="caption">THE NIGHT-WATCH.</span>
</p>

<p>The Inn of the North was dirty and unkempt; a frightful odor from
the donkey-stable and other sources streamed up into our window between
shutters heavy as church doors; and the descant of the watch,
relieved by violent cock-crows, disturbed us all night. Nevertheless, we
awoke with a good deal of eagerness when the alert young woman with
dark pink cheeks and snapping eyes who served us came to the door
with chocolate and bread, water and <i>azucarillos</i>, betimes next morning.
It was the festival of Corpus Christi; but although every one was going
to see the procession, no one could tell us anything about it. Unless
he be extraordinarily shrewd, a foreigner can hardly help arriving in
Spain on some kind of a feast-day. When the people cannot get up
a whole holiday, they will have a fractional one. You go about the
streets cheerfully, thinking you will buy something at leisure in the afternoon;
but when you approach the shop commerce has vanished, and
is out taking a walk, or drinking barley-water in honor of some obscure
saint. You engage a guide and carriage to visit some public building,
and both guide and carriage are silent as to the religious character of
the day until you arrive and find the place shut, when full price, or
at least half, is confidently demanded. Church feasts are a matter of
course, but you are expected to know about them, and questions are
considered out of place. In this case we had kept Corpus Christi in
mind, and as Burgos is a small place, the "function" could not by any
possibility escape us.</p>

<p>The garrison turned out, and military music played in the procession,
but otherwise it was a quaint reproduction of the antique. The
quiet streets, innocent of traffic, were filled with peasants whose garments,
odoriferous with age and dirt, made a dazzle of color, especially
the bright yellow flannel skirts of the women, and the gay handkerchief
which men and women alike employ here. Sometimes it is worn
around the shoulders, sometimes around the head, and sometimes both:
but everywhere and always handkerchiefs are brought into play as essentials.
From almost every balcony, too, hung bedquilts, or sheets
scalloped with red and blue, in emulation of the tapestries and banners
that once graced these occasions. Amid a tumultuous tumbling of bells
up amid the carven gray stone-work of the cathedral, the candles and<a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a>
images and tonsured priests, clad in resplendent copes, moved forth,
attended by civil functionaries in swallow-tailed coats or old crimson
robes of the twelfth century. But the prettiest sight, and a much more
striking one than the gilt effigies of St. Lawrence and St. Stephen and
the rest, under toy canopies and wreathed with false flowers, was that
of two little boys, nude except for the snowy lamb-skins they wore, who
personated Christ and St. John. The Christ rode on a lamb, and kept
his head very steady under a big curled wig made after the old masters.
We saw him afterward in his father's arms, still holding his hands prayerfully,
as he had been drilled, with a look of sweet, childish awe in his
face.</p>

<span class="caption">DANCING BOYS.</span>
</p>

<p>When the procession was about to return, we were amazed, in gazing
at the small street from which it should emerge, to behold eight
huge figures, looking half as high as the houses, in long robes, and with
placidly unreal expressions on their gigantic faces, advancing with that
peculiar unconscious gait due to human leg-power when concealed under
papier-maché monsters. It took but a glance, as they filed out and<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a>
aligned themselves on the small sunny square, to recognize in them the
Kings of the Earth, come in person to do homage before the Christ.
One bore a crown and ermine as insignia of the Castilian line; others
were Moors; and even China was represented. After them danced a
dozen boys, in pink tunics and bell-crowned hats of drab felt quaintly
beribboned, throwing themselves about fantastically, with snapping fingers
and castanets. They formed in two ranks, just under the grand
shadowy entrance arch, to receive the pageant. A drummer and two
<i>flautistas</i> in festive attire accompanied them; and whenever a monstrance
or holy image was borne past, the flutes mingled with the drum
eccentric bagpipe discords, at which the boys broke into a prancing jig
and rattled their castanets to express their devout joy. Two other
men in harlequin dress, wearing tall, pointed hats, stood on the edge of
the eager crowd, and belabored those who pressed too close with horse-hair
switches attached by a long cord to slender sticks. This part of
the performance was conducted with great energy and seriousness, and
seemed to be received with due reverence by the thick heads which got
hit. A more heathenish rite than this jig at the sanctuary gate could
hardly be imagined.</p>

<p>"Are these things possible, and is this the nineteenth century?" exclaimed
my friend and companion, who, however, had been guilty of an
indigestion that day.</p>

<p>I confess that for myself I enjoyed the dance, and could not help
being struck by the contrast of this boyish gayety with the heavy gorgeousness
of the priests and the immobile frown of the sculptured figures
on the massive ogee arch.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Then when the Host was carried by
in the <i>custodia</i>, and the motley crowd kneeled and bared their heads,
we sunk to the pavement with them, our knees being assisted possibly
by the statement we had heard that, a few years since, blows or knives
were the prompt reward of non-conformity. Afterward, when secular
amusements ensued, our boys went about, stopping now and then in
open places to execute strange dances, with hoops and ribbons and
wooden swords, for the general enjoyment. A gleeful sight they made
against backgrounds of old archways, or perhaps the mighty Arch of<a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a>
Santa Maria, one of the local glories, peopled with statues of ancient
counts and knights and rulers.</p>

<p>No Spanish town is without its paseo&mdash;its public promenade; and<a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a>
in Burgos this is supplied by The Spur&mdash;a broad esplanade skirting the
shrunken river, with borders of chubby shade trees and shrubbery. On
Corpus Christi the citizens also turned out in the arcades of the Main
Plaza. Here, and later in the dusty dusk of The Spur, they crowded
and chatted, in accordance with native ideas of enjoyment; and except
that their mantillas and shoulder-veils<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> made a difference, the señoras
and señoritas might have passed for Americans, so delicate were their
features, so trim their daintily-attired figures, though perhaps they
hadn't a coin in their pockets. The men had the universal Iberian
habit of carrying their light overcoats folded over the left shoulder;
but their quick nervous expression and spare faces would have been
quite in place on Wall Street. Spanish ladies are allowed far more
liberty than the French or English in public; but though they walked
without male escort, they showed remarkable skill in avoiding any direct
look at men from their own lustrous eyes. During the accredited
hours of the paseo, however, gallants and friends are suffered to walk
close behind them&mdash;so close that the entire procession often comes to
a stand-still&mdash;and to whisper complimentary speeches into their ears;
no one, not even relatives of the damsels, resenting this freedom.</p>

<p>At Las Huelgas, a famous convent near the town, much resorted
to by nuns of aristocratic family (even the Empress Eugénie it was
thought would retire thither after her son's death), the fête was renewed
next day; and it was here that we saw beggars in perfection.
A huge stork's nest was perched high on one end of the chapel, as on
many churches of Spain. Bombs were fired above the crowd from the
high square tower that rose into the hot air not far from the inner
shrine; and in the chapel below the nuns were at their devotions, caged
behind heavy iron lattices that barely disclosed their picturesque head-dress.
Meanwhile peasants and burghers wandered aimlessly about,
looking at pictures, relics, and inscriptions in an outer arcade; after
which the holiday of the people began. Holiday here means either
walking or sleeping. In a sultry, dusty little square by the convent,
covered with trees, the people went to sleep, or sat talking, and occasionally
eating or drinking with much frugality. The first object that
had greeted us by daylight in Burgos was a marvellous mendicant clad
in an immense cloak, one mass of patches&mdash;in fact, a monument of indigence&mdash;carrying
on his head a mangy fur cap, with a wallet at his
waist to contain alms. The beggars assembled at Las Huelgas were<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a>
quite as bad, except that they mostly had the good taste to remain
asleep. In any attitude, face down or up, on stone benches or on the
grass, they dozed at a moment's notice, reposing piously. One sat for
a long time torpid near us, but finally mustered energy to come and
entreat us. He received a copper, whereupon he kissed the coin, murmured
a blessing, and again retreated to his shadow. Another, having
acquired something from some other source, halted near us to find his
pocket. He searched long among his rags, and plunged fiercely into a
big cavity which exposed his dirty linen; but this proved to be only a
tear in his trousers, and he was at last obliged to tie his treasure to a
voluminous string around his waist, letting it hang down thence into
some interior vacancy of rags.</p>

<p>It may not be generally known that beggars are licensed in Spain.
Veteran soldiers, instead of receiving a pension, are generously endowed
with official permission to seek charity; the Church gives doles to the
poor, and citizens consider it a virtue to relieve the miserable objects
who petition for pence at every turn. As we came from Las Huelgas
we saw the maimed and blind and certain more robust paupers creeping
up to the door of a church, where priests were giving out food. A
little farther on an emaciated crone at a bridge-head, with eyes shut
fast in sleep, lifted her hand mechanically and repeated her formula.
We were convinced that, since she could do this in her slumbers, she
must have been satisfied with merely dreaming of that charity we did
not bestow.</p>

<p>It was a favorable season for the beggars, and many of them sunned
their bodies, warped and scarred by hereditary disease, on the cathedral
steps. But professional enterprise with them was constantly hindered
by the tendency to nap. One old fellow I saw who, feeling a brotherhood
between himself and the broken-nosed statues, had mounted into
a beautiful niche there and coiled himself in sleep, first hauling his
wooden leg up after him like a drawbridge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the peasants kept on swarming into the town, decorating
it with their blue and red and yellow kerchiefs and kirtles, as with a
mass of small moving banners. The men wore vivid sashes, leather
leggings, and laced sandals. It was partly for enjoyment they came,
and partly to sell produce. All alike were to be met with at noon,
squatting down in any sheltered coigne of street or square, every group
with a bowl in its midst containing the common dinner. There were
also little eating-houses, in which they regaled themselves on bread and
sardines, with a special cupful of oil thrown in, or on salt meat. A<a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a>
lively trade in various small articles was carried on in the Main Plaza;
among them loaves of tasteless white bread, hard as tiles, and delicious
cherries, recalling the farms of New York. Another product was offered,
the presence of which in large quantity was like a sarcasm. This
was Castile soap. It must have taken an immense effort of imagination
on the part of these people to think of manufacturing an article for
which they have so little use. I am bound to add that I did not see
an ounce of it sold; and I have my suspicions that the business is
merely a traditional one&mdash;the same big cheese-like chunks being probably
brought out at every fair and fête, as a time-honored symbol of
Castilian prosperity. But, after all, so devout a community must be
convinced that it possesses godliness; and having that, what do they
need of the proximate virtue? This is the region where the inhabitants
refer to themselves as "old and rancid Castilians;" and the expression
is appropriate.</p>

<br />
<span class="caption">PEASANTS IN THE MARKET-PLACE.</span>
</p>

<p>The most intolerable odor pervaded the whole place. It was a singular
mixture, arising from the trustful local habit of allowing every<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a>
kind of garbage and ordure to disperse itself without drainage, and
complicated with fumes of oil, garlic, general mustiness, and a whiff
or two of old incense. The potency of olive-oil, especially when somewhat
rank, none can know who have not been in Spain. That first
steak&mdash;how tempting it looked among its potatoes, but how abominably
it tasted! We never approached meat with the same courage afterward,
until our senses were subdued to the level of fried oil. Combine
this with the odor of corruption, and you have the insinuating quality
which we soon noticed even in the wine&mdash;perhaps from the custom
of transporting it in badly dressed pig-skins, which impart an animal
flavor. This astonishing local atmosphere saluted us everywhere; it
was in our food and drink; we breathed it and dreamed of it. Yet the
Burgalese flourished in calm unconsciousness thereof. The splendidly
blooming peasant women showed their perfect teeth at us; and the
men, in broad-brimmed, pointed caps and embroidered jackets, whose
feet were brown and earthy as tree-roots, laughed outright, strong in
the knowledge of their traditionary soap, at our ignorant foreign clothes
and over-washed hands! Among the humbler class were some who
were prepared to sell labor&mdash;an article not much in demand&mdash;and they
were even more calmly squalid than the beggars. They sat in ranks on
the curb-stones of the plaza, a matchless array of tatters; and if they
could have been conveyed without alteration to Paris or New York,
there would have been sharp competition for them between the artists
and paper-makers.</p>

<p>So my companion, the artist, assured me&mdash;whom, by-the-way, in
order to give him local color, I had rechristened Velazquez. But as
he shrank from the large implication of this name, I softened him
down to Velveteen.</p>

<p>
We had been twenty-four hours in Burgos before we saw a carriage,
excepting only the hotel coach, which stood most of the time without
horses in front of the door, and was used by the porter as a private
gambling den and loafing place for himself and his friends. When
wheels did roll along the pavements they awoke a roar as of musketry.
Perhaps the most important event which took place during our stay&mdash;it
was certainly regarded with a more feverish interest by the inhabitants
than the Corpus Christi ceremonies&mdash;was the bold act of
our landlady, who went out to drive in a barouche, while her less daring
spouse hung out of the window weakly staring at her. The house-fronts
were filled with well-dressed feminine heads, witnessing the departure;
a grave old gentleman opposite left his book and glared out<a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a>
intently. When the wheels
could no longer even be
heard, he turned to gaze
wistfully in the opposite
direction, dimly hoping
that life might vouchsafe
him a carriage.

<p>
Although, as I have
said, women avoid meeting
male glances when
on the sidewalk, they
enjoy full license to
stand at their high windows,
which are called
<i>miradores</i>, or "lookers,"
and contemplate with
entire freedom all
things or persons
that pass; which, in
view of the complete
listlessness of
their lives, is a fortunate
dispensation.
Existence in Burgos
is essentially life
from the window
point of view. It
proceeds idly, and as
a sort of accidental
spectacle. Yet there
is for strangers a dull
fascination in wandering
about the narrow,
silent streets, and contemplating
ancient
buildings, the chiselled
ornaments and armorial
bearings of which recall
the wealth and nobility
that once inhabited<a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a>
them during the great days of the town. Where have all the dominant
families gone? Are they keeping store, or tending the railroad
station? Their descendants are sometimes only too happy if they
can get some petty government office at five hundred dollars a year.
I strolled one afternoon into the Calle de la Calera, and through a
shabby archway penetrated to a stately old ruined court, around
which ran an inscription in stone, declaring this palace to have been
reared by an abbot of aristocratic line a century or two since. It is
used now as an oil factory. A pretty girl was looking out over a
flower-pot in an upper window, and, as I strayed up the noble staircase,
I met a sad-looking gentleman coming down, who I afterward
learned was a widower, formerly resident in Paris, but now returned
with his daughter to this strange domicile in his native place. Some
of the lower rooms, again, were devoted to plebeians and donkeys.
</p>

<p>The humble ass, by-the-way, begins to thrust himself meekly upon
you as soon as you set foot in the Peninsula, and you must look sharp
if you wish to keep out of his way. His cheap labor has ruined and
driven out the haughtier equine stock of Arabia that once pawed this
devoted soil. Even the Cid, however, did not boast a barb of the
desert in the earlier days of his prowess; for when King Alfonso bade
him quit the land, "then the Cid clapped spurs to the mule upon
which he rode, and vaulted into a piece of ground which was his own
inheritance, and answered, 'Sire, I am not in your land, but in my
own.'" This little incident occurred near Burgos, and the drowsy
city still keeps some dim memory of that great Warrior Lord the Cid
Campeador, Rodrigo de Bivar, whose quaint story, full of hardihood,
robbery, and cruelty, gallant deeds and grim pathos, trails along the
track of his adventures through half of Spain. But there is a curious
cheapness and indifference in the memorials of him preserved. In
the Town-hall, for the sum of ten cents, you are admitted to view
the modern walnut receptacle wherein all that is left of him is economically
stored. Those puissant bones, which went through so many
hard fights against the Moors, are seen lying here, dusty and loose, with
those of Ximena, under the glass cover. Among them reposes a portly
corked bottle, in which minor fragments of the warrior lord were
placed after the moving of his remains from the Convent of San Pedro
in chains, where for many years he occupied a more seemly tomb.
Imagine George Washington, partially bottled and wholly disjointed,
on exhibition under glass! The Spaniards, in no way disconcerted
by the incongruity, have graven on the brass plate of the case a high-sounding<a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a>
inscription; but a tribute as genuine and not less valuable,
though humbler, was the big, spruce-looking modern wagon I saw in
the market-place one day, driven by an energetic farmer, and bearing
on its side the title <i>El Cid</i>.</p>

<p>One would look to see the conqueror's dust richly inurned within
the cathedral&mdash;a noble outgrowth of the thirteenth century, enriched
by accretions of later work until its whitish stone and wrought marble
connect the Early Pointed style with that of the Renaissance in
its flower. But perhaps this temple has enough without the Cid.
Strangely placed on the side of a hill, with houses attached to one
corner, as if it had sprung from the homes and hearts of the people,
it seems to hold down the swelling ground with its massive weight;
yet the spires, through the open-work of which the stars may be seen
at night, rise with such lightness you would think the heavy bells
might make them tremble and fall. I passed an hour of peace and
fresh air above the fetid streets, looking down from the citadel hill
on these pinnacles, while around and below them lay the town&mdash;an
irregular mass of gray and mauve pierced with deep shadows&mdash;in the
midst of bare, rolling uplands. Before the fair high altar hangs the
victorious banner of Ferdinand VII., recalling to the people the great
battle of Tolosa Plains. And when one sees peasants&mdash;rough spots
of color in the sombre choir&mdash;studying the dark, fruit-like wood-carvings
through which the Bible story wreathes itself in panel after panel,
one feels the teaching power of these old churches for the unlettered.
In one of the corner chapels appears another less favorable phase of
such teaching, in the shape of a miracle-working Christ, amid deep
shadows and dim lantern-light, stretched on the cross, and draped
with a satin crinoline. This doubtful reverence of putting a short
skirt on the figure of the Saviour, often practiced in Spain, may perhaps
mark an influence unconsciously received from the Moorish dislike
for nudity. The cathedral bells were continually clanging the
summons to mass or vespers, and their loud voices, though cracked
and inharmonious, seemed still to assert the supremacy of ecclesiastical
power. But while a priest occasionally darkened the sidewalks,
many others, on account of the growing prejudice against them, went
about in frock-coats and ordinary tall hats. And under all its crowning
beauty the old minster, motionless in the centre of the stagnant
town&mdash;its chief entrance walled up, and a notice painted on its
Late Roman façade warning boys not to play ball against the tempting
masonry&mdash;wore the look of some neglected and half-blind thing,<a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a>
once glorious, symbol of a power abruptly stayed in its prodigious
career.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the daily history of Burgos went on its wonted way,
sleepy but picturesque&mdash;a sort of illuminated prose. Women chaffered
in the blue-tiled fish-market; the <i>bourgeoisie</i> patronized the sweetmeat
shops, of which there were ten on the limited chief square; the tambourine-maker
varied this ornamental industry with the construction of
the more practical sieve; a peasant passed with a bundle of purple-flowering
vetches on his head for fodder, and another drove six milch
goats through the streets, seeking a purchaser. To this last one the
proprietor of the principal book-store came running out to see if he
could strike a bargain. One morning I met an uncouth countryman
and his stout wife on the red-tiled landing of the inn stairs (they bowed
and courtesied to me) with chickens and eggs for sale. In this simple
manner our hotel was supplied. All the bread was got, a few pieces at
a time, from a small bakery across the plazuela, in a dark cellar just
under the niche of a neglected stone saint&mdash;a new arrival causing our
maid to run hurriedly thither for a couple of rolls; and the water also
came from some neighbor's well in earthen jars. The barber even exercises
his primitive function in Burgos: he is called a "bleeder," and
announces on his shop sign that "teeth and molars" are extracted
there. Democratic and provincial the atmosphere was, and not unpleasantly
so; yet during our stay Italian opera from Madrid was performing
in the theatre, and large yellow posters promised "Bulls in
Burgos" at an early date.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>T<small>O</small> pass from this ancient city to Madrid is to experience one of
those astonishing contrasts in which the country abounds.</p>

<p>We dropped asleep in the rough, time-worn regions of Old Castile,
and in the morning found ourselves amid the glare and bustle of
reconstructed Spain, as it displays itself on the great square called the
Gate of the Sun&mdash;a spot with no hint of poetry about it other than its
name. Madrid adopts largely the Parisian style of street architecture,
and has in portions a resemblance to Boston. The sense of remoteness
aroused in the north here suddenly fades, though the traits that mark
a foreign land soon re-assemble and take shape in a new framework.
Perhaps, too, our first rather flat impression was due to an exhausting
night journey and some accompanying incidents.<a name="page_017" id="page_017"></a></p>

</p>

<p>"The Spaniards are a nation of robbers!" a cheerful French gentleman
of Bordeaux had told us;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and he threw out warnings of certain
little coin tricks in which they were adepts. When two Civil Guards,
armed with swords and guns, inspected our train at the frontier, we
recalled his statement. These guards persistently popped up at every
succeeding station. No matter how fast the train went, there they
were always waiting; always two of them, always with the same mustached
faces, and the same white havelocks fluttering on their bunchy
cocked hats of the French Revolution, and making their swarthy cheeks
and black eyes fiercer by contrast. In fact, they were obviously the same
men. Every time they marched up and down the platform, scanning
the cars in a determined manner, and scowling at our compartment
in a way that fully persuaded us some one must be guilty. Indeed,
before long we became convinced that we ourselves were suspicious;
but it would have been a relief if they had taken us in hand at once.
Why should they go on glaring at us and swinging their guns, as if it
were a good deal easier to shoot us than not, unless it was that we were
too rich a "find" to be disposed of immediately&mdash;squandered, as it were?
Perhaps the torture of suspense suited the enormity of our case, but it
was certainly cruel. There was some satisfaction, however, in finding
that when we left the depôt they allowed us a restricted liberty, and kept
out of our way. If it had been otherwise, I don't know what they would
have done to us at Burgos, for it was there that the landlady forced upon
us a gold piece that would not pass, in exchange for a good one which
we had given her. This very simple device was one of which the French
gentleman had told us. But we were too confiding. The money to pay<a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a>
the bill was sent away by a servant, and once out of sight was easily
replaced with inferior coin. Disturbed by this episode, we went to our
train, which started with the watchman's first hail at eleven, and stumbled
hastily into an empty compartment, which we soon converted into
a sleeping-carriage by making our bundles pillows, drawing curtains, and
pulling the silk screen over the lamp. Our nap was broken only by a
halt at the next station. There was a long, drowsy pause, during which
the train seemed to be pretending it hadn't been asleep. It was nearly
time to go on, when feminine voices drew near our carriage; the door
was thrown open, and two ladies quickly entered. There was no time
for retreat; the usual fish-horn and dinner-bell accompaniment announced
our departure, and the wheels moved. Then it was that one
of the new-comers uttered a half scream, and we saw that she was a
nun!</p>

<p>Had it been a cooler night our blood might have frozen; but as it
failed us, we did what we could by feeling greatly embarrassed. The
nun and her travelling companion had been speaking Spanish as they
approached, and we tried in that language to impress on them our
harmless devotion to their convenience.</p>

<p>"But he said it was reserved for ladies," murmured the sister, in
good English.</p>

<p>The terrible truth was now clear. My eye caught, at the same
instant, a card in the window which proved beyond question that we
had got into the carriage for señoras.</p>

<p>The result of this adventure was that we found the nun to be an
English Catholic, employed in teaching at a religious establishment,
and her friend another Englishwoman protecting her on her journey.
Pleasant conversation ensued, and we had almost forgotten that we
were criminals, when the speed of the engine slackened again, and
the thought of the Civil Guards returned to haunt us. We did not
dare remain, yet we were sure that our military pursuers would confront
us again on the platform. There indeed they were, when we
tumbled out into the obscurity, with their white-hooded heads looming
above their muskets in startling disconnectedness. Telling Velazquez,
with all the firmness I possessed, to bare his breast to the avenging
sword, I hastened to get into a coupé, preferring to die comfortably.
He, however, ignominiously followed me. It is true, we were not molested;
but the shock of that narrow escape kept us wakeful.</p>

<p>Not even our own prairies, I think, could present so dreary and
monotonous an outlook as the wide, endless, treeless Castilian plains<a name="page_019" id="page_019"></a>
while morning slowly felt its way across them. Brown and cold they
were, skirted by white roads, and all shorn of their barley crops,
though it was but middle June. Now and then a village was seen
huddled against some low slope&mdash;a church lifting its tall, square campanario
above the humble roofs against the pearling sky. Interior
Spain is a desolate land, but the Church thrives there and draws its
tax from the poverty-stricken inhabitants&mdash;a crowned beggar ruling
over beggars.</p>

<p>If the first man were now to be created from the clay of this region,
he would doubtless turn out the very type of a lean hidalgo. The
human product of such soil must perforce be meagre and melancholy;
and the pensiveness which we see in most Spanish faces seems a reflection
of the landscape which surrounds them.</p>

<p>The Madrileños offer not a flat, but rather an extremely round
contradiction to this general and accepted idea of the national appearance.
Slenderness is the exception with them. Their city is a forced
flower in the midst of mountain lands, and the men themselves rejoice
in a rotund and puffy look of success, which also partakes of the hot-house
character. They are people of leisure, and, after their manner,
of pleasure. How they swarm in the cafés in the Gate of the Sun&mdash;where
they keep up the Moorish custom of calling waiters by two
claps of the hands&mdash;or on the one great thoroughfare, Calle de Alcalá,
or in the bull-ring of a Sunday! They are never at rest, yet never
altogether active. They never sleep, or, if they do, others take their
places in the public resorts. The clamor of the streets, and even the
snarling cry of the news-venders&mdash;"<i>La Correspondencia</i>," or "<i>El Demó-crata-a</i>"&mdash;is
kept up until the small hours; and at five or six the restless
stir begins again with the silver tinkling of fleet mule-bells. There
are no night-howling watchmen in Madrid; but the custom of street-hawking
is rampant in Spain; and here, in addition to the newsmen,
we have the wail of the water-criers, ministering to an unquenchable
popular thirst, the lottery-ticket sellers, the wax-match peddlers, and
a dozen others. The favorite bird of the country is a kind of lark
called <i>alondra</i>, much hung in cages outside the windows, whence they
utter&mdash;with that monotonous recurrence which seems a fixed principle
of all things Spanish&mdash;a hard, piercing triple note impossible to ignore.
This loud, persistent "twit, twit-twit," resembling at a distance the
click of castanets, begins with daybreak, and gives a most discouraging
notion of the Spanish musical ear.</p>

<p>But the watchmen are merciful. They are called, as elsewhere,<a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a>
<i>serenos</i>, which may mean either "quiet," or "night-dews," but their
function in Madrid is peculiar. Early in the evening they come out
by squads, with staves of office, and at their girdles bright lanterns and
an immense bunch of keys. These are the night-keys of all the houses
on each man's beat, the residents not being allowed to have any.
When a person returns home late&mdash;and who does not, in Madrid&mdash;he
is obliged to find his sereno, and if that officer is not in sight, calls
him by name&mdash;"Frascuelo," or "Pepino." Whereupon Frascuelo, or
Pepino, or Santiago, if he hears, will come along and unlock the door.
This curious system should at least encourage good habits; for, unless
a man be sober, his watchman may have unpleasant tales to tell of
him.</p>

<p>The feline race being too often homeless, and having a proverbial
taste for nocturnal wanderings, the average male citizen of the capital
feelingly nicknames himself a "Madrid cat." This shows a frankness
of self-characterization, to say the least, unusual. Of course there is
home life, and there is family affection, in Madrid, but the stranger
naturally does not see a great deal of these; and then it may be
doubted whether they really exist to the same extent as in most other
civilized capitals. It becomes wearisome to make sallies upon the
town, and day after day find so much of the population trying to divert
itself, or killing time in the cafés and clubs. The feeling deepens
that they resort to these for want of a sufficiently close interest in
their homes. More than that, they do not seem really to be amused.
Even their language fails to express the amusement idea; the most
that anything can be for them, in the vernacular, is "entertaining."
Still the choice of light diversion is varied enough. Opera flourishes
in winter; in spring and summer the bull-fight; theatres are always
in blast; cocking-mains are kept up. Hitherto gambling has been
another favorite pastime until checked by the authorities. Not content
with all this, the Madrileños seek in lottery shops that excitement
which Americans derive from drinking-saloons. The brightly lighted
lottery agency occurs as frequently as that other indication of disease,
the apothecary's window, or the stock-market "ticker," in American
cities. People of all classes hover about them both by day and by
night. Posters confront you with announcements of the Child Jesus
Lottery, the lottery to aid the Asylum of Our Lady of the Assumption,
or the National, which is drawn thrice a month, with a chief prize of
thirty-two thousand dollars, and some four hundred other premiums.
There are many small drawings besides constantly going on: not a<a name="page_021" id="page_021"></a>
day passes, in fact, without your being solicited by wandering dealers
in these alluring chances at least half a dozen times.</p>

<span class="caption">THE PLAZA MAYOR.</span>
</p>

<p>Altogether, looking from my balcony upon the characteristic crowd
in the great square, leading this life so busy yet so apathetic, as if in a
slow fever, Madrid struck me as only one more great human ant-hill,
where the ants were trying to believe themselves in Paris. The Parisian
resemblance, however, is confined to strips through the middle and on the
edges of the city, and as soon as one's steps are bent away from those,
the narrow ways and older architecture of Spain re-appear. Only a few
rods from the Puerta del Sol lies the Plaza Mayor, which once enjoyed
all the honors of bull-fights and heretic burnings&mdash;occasions on which
householders were obliged by their leases to give up all the front rooms
and balconies to be used as boxes for the audience. From the Plaza
Mayor again an arch leads into Toledo Street&mdash;old meandering mart full
of mantles and sashes, blankets and guitars, flannel dyed in the national
colors of red and yellow, basket-work and wood-work, including the
carved sticks known as <i>molinillos</i> (little mills), with which chocolate is<a name="page_022" id="page_022"></a>
mixed by a dexterous spinning motion. The donkey feels himself at
home once more in these narrow thoroughfares; the evil sewage smell,
which oozes through even the most pretentious edifices in the new
quarters, diffuses itself again in full vigor, and the cafés become dingy
and unconventional. On the Alcalá, or San Geronimo, the carefully-dressed
men sip beer and cordials, or possibly indulge in sparkling
sherry&mdash;a new and expensive wine like dry champagne; but here the
rougher element is satisfied with <i>aguardiente</i> (the liquor distilled from
anise-seed), and quite as often confines itself to water. The lower orders
are temperate. Peasants and porters and petty traders will sit
down contentedly for a whole evening to a glass of water in which is
dissolved a long meringue (called <i>asucarillo</i>, literally "sugarette"), or
to a snow lemonade. Another esteemed cooling beverage is the <i>horchata
de chufas</i>, a kind of cream made from pounded cypress root and
then half frozen. The height of luxury is to order with this, at an
added cost of some two cents, a few tubular wafers, fancifully named
<i>barquillos</i> (or little boats), through which the semi-liquid may be sucked.
This barquillo is considered so desirable that boys carry it on the street
in large metal cylinders, the top of which is a disk inscribed with numbers.
You pay a fee, and he revolves on the disk a pivotal needle, the
number at which it stops deciding how many wafers fall to your lot.
In this way the excruciating pleasure of barquillos to eat is combined
with the national delight in gaming.</p>

<p>European costume has fallen on the Madrid people like a pall, blotting
out picturesqueness; but peasants of all provinces are still seen,
and now and then a turbaned figure from Barbary moves across the
street. Nor is the fascinating mantilla quite extinct among women,
in spite of their more than Parisian grace and splendor of modern robing.
There are humble old women squatted on the sidewalk at street
corners, who sell water and liquors and shrub from bottles kept in a
singular little stand with brass knobs like an exaggerated pair of casters;
and when one sees the varied types of peasant, soldier, citizen,
or priest, with perhaps a veiled woman of the middle class, gathered
around one of these, the Spanish quality of the town re-asserts itself
distinctly. So it does, too, when a carriage containing the princesses
of the royal household rattles down the Prado Park, drawn by mules in
barbaric red-tasselled harness, and preceded by a courier who wears a
sort of gold-braided nightcap.</p>

<p>There is no cathedral at Madrid, but the churches, smeared as usual
with gold and stucco and paint in tasteless extravagance, are numerous<a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a>
enough; and on many a balcony I saw withered straw-like plumes, long
as a man, hung up in commemoration of the last Palm-Sunday. The
morning papers have a "religious bulletin" in the amusement column,
giving the saints and services of the day; besides which special masses
for the souls of departed capitalists are constantly announced, with a
request that friends shall attend. These paid rites doubtless offer a
pleasant exception to the routine of commonplace church-going. Thus,
while the men are absorbed by their cafés and politics, their countless
cigarettes and lottery tickets, with a minimum of business and a maximum
of dominoes, the women fill up their time with matins and vespers,<a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a>
confessions and intrigues. It would be merely repeating the frank
assertion of the Spanish men themselves to say that feminine morals
here are in a lamentable state; but at least appearances are always
carefully guarded, and if judged by externals only, Madrid is far more
virtuous than London or Paris. As for local society, it exists so much
on appearances that the substance suffers. It is true, the ladies are
beautiful and of noble stature; and their costumes, governed by the<a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a>
happiest taste, surpass in luxury
those seen in public in almost any
other city. The cavaliers are, without
exception, the best-dressed gentlemen
in the world; and the mass of sumptuous equipages, with polished
grooms and surpassingly fine horses, which crowds the broad
Castilian Fountain drive, or the Park road on the east of the Buen
Retiro gardens, during fashionable hours, is amazing. Great wealth is
gathered in the hands of a few nobles, who often draw heavy salaries
from government for long-obsolete services; but the most of this
costuming and grooming is attained by semi-starvation at home. By
consequence, dinners and dancing-parties are rarely given even in the
season, and royalty itself provides no more than a couple of balls, with
two or three state dinners, a year.</p>

<p>To be sure, no capital is better provided with sundry of the higher
means to cultivation, as its Royal Armory, its Archæological Museum,
and its glorious Picture-gallery&mdash;in some respects the noblest of Europe&mdash;remind
one. Moreover, in the neighboring Escorial, that dark
jewel in the head of Philip II., travellers find a rich monument of art,
albeit to many eyes unseen inscriptions perhaps record there more than
enough of Spain's misfortunes. In the Madrid gallery the stately,
severe, and robust royal portraits by Velazquez, or his magnificently
healthy "Drunkards," reveal in their way, as do the Virgins of Murillo,
floating divinely in translucent air, that deep and deathless power of<a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a>
Spanish temperament and genius over which slumber has reigned so
long. The pictures of Ribera, hanging together, are like loose pages
torn from Spanish ecclesiastical history and legend: a collection of
monks, ascetics, martyrs&mdash;scenes of torture depicted with relentless
and savage vigor. Goya, again, scarcely known out of Spain, left at
the beginning of this century portraits of wonderful vitality and finish,
fresh glimpses of popular life, and wild figure compositions marked by
the fierce, half insane energy of a Latinized William Blake. His imagination
and manner were both original. Though falling short, like all
other Spanish painters, in ideality, he had that faculty of fertile improvisation
so refreshing in Murillo's naturalistic "Madonna of the
Birdling," or in his "St. Elizabeth," and "Roman Patrician's Dream,"
at the Academy of Fine Arts. But it is not with these past splendors,
still full of hopes for new futures, that the Castilian gentlemen and
ladies of our varnished period concern themselves. The opera, the
circus, and the <i>Corrida de Toros</i>&mdash;the irrepressible bull-fight&mdash;are to
them of far more consequence.</p>

<p>In every crowd and café you see the tall, shapely, dark-faced, silent
men, with a cool, professionally murderous look like that of our border
desperadoes, whose enormously wide black hats, short jackets, tight
trousers, and pigtails of braided hair proclaim them <i>chulos</i>, or members
of the noble ring. Intrepid, with muscles of steel, and finely formed,
they are very illiterate: we saw one of them gently taking his brandy
at the Café de Paris after a hard combat, while his friend read from an
evening paper a report of the games in which he had just fought&mdash;the
man's own education not enabling him to decipher print. But the higher
class of these professionals are the idols, the demi-gods, of the people.
Songs are made about them, their deeds are painted on fans, and popular
chromos illustrate their loves and woes; people crowd around to see
them in hotels or on the street as if they were heroes or star tragedians.
Pet dogs are named for the well-known ones; and it was even rumored
that one of the chief swordsmen had secured the affections of a patrician
lady, and would have married her but for the interference of her
friends. Certain it is that a whole class of young bucks of the lower
order&mdash;"'Arrys" is the British term&mdash;get themselves up in the closest
allowable imitation of bull-fighters, down to the tuft of hair left growing
in front of the ear. The <i>espadas</i> or <i>matadores</i> (killers), who give
the mortal blow, hire each one his <i>cuadrilla</i>&mdash;a corps of assistants,
including <i>picadores</i>, <i>banderilleros</i>, and <i>punterillo</i>. For every fight they
receive five hundred dollars, and sometimes they lay up large fortunes.<a name="page_027" id="page_027"></a>
To see the sport well from a seat in the shade, one must pay
well. Tickets are monopolized by speculators, who, no less than the
fighters, have their "ring," and gore buyers as the bull does horses. We
gave two dollars apiece for places. The route to the Place of Bulls is
lined for a mile with omnibuses, tartanas, broken-down diligences, and
wheezy cabs, to convey intending spectators to the fight on Sunday
afternoons. A stream of pedestrians file in the same direction, and
the showy turnouts of the rich add dignity to what soon becomes a
wild rush for the scene of action. The mule-bells ring like a rain of
metal, whips crack, the drivers shout wildly, and at full gallop we dash
by windows full of on-lookers, by the foaming fountains of the Prado,
and up the road to the grim
Colosseum of stone and brick,
in the midst of scorched and
arid fields, with the faint peaks
of the snow-capped Guadarrama
range seen, miles to the
north, through dazzling white
sunshine.</p>

<span class="caption">PLAN OF THE BULL-RING.</span>
</p>

<p>Within is the wide ring, sunk in a circular pit of terraced granite
crowned by galleries. The whole great round, peopled by at least ten
thousand beings, is divided exactly by the sun and the shadow&mdash;<i>sol y
sombra</i>; and from our cool place we look at the vivid orange sand of
the half arena in sunlight, and the tiers of seats beyond, where swarms
of paper fans (red, yellow, purple, and green) are wielded to shelter the
eyes of those in the cheaper section, or bring air to their lungs. No
connected account of a bull tourney can impart the vividness, the rapid
changes, the suspense, the skill, the picturesqueness, or horror of the
actual thing. All occurs in rapid glimpses, in fierce, dramatic, brilliant,
and often ghastly pictures, which fade and re-form in new phases on the
instant. The music is sounding, the fans are fluttering, amateurs strolling
between the wooden barriers of the ring and the lowest seats,
hatless men are hawking fruit and aguardiente, when trumpets announce
the grand entry. It is a superb sight: the picadores with gorgeous
jackets and long lances on horseback, in wide Mexican hats, their
armor-cased legs in buckskin trousers; the swordsmen and others on<a name="page_029" id="page_029"></a>
foot, shining with gold and silver embroidery on scarlet and blue, bright
green, saffron, or puce-colored garments, carrying cloaks of crimson,
violet, and canary. At the head is the mounted <i>alguazil</i> in ominous
black, who carries the key of the bull-gate. Everything is punctual,
orderly, ceremonious.</p>

<p>Then the white handkerchief, as signal, from the president of the
games in his box; the trumpet-blare again; and the bull rushing from
his lair! There is a wild moment when, if he be of good breed, he
launches himself impetuous as the ball from a thousand-ton gun directly
upon his foes, and sweeping around half the circle, puts them to flight
over the barrier or into mid-ring, leaving a horse or two felled in his
track. I have seen one fierce Andalusian bull within ten minutes kill
five horses while making two circuits of the ring. The first onset
against a horse is horrible to witness. The poor steed, usually lean and
decrepit, is halted until the bull will charge him, when instantly the
picador in the saddle aims a well-poised blow with his lance, driving the
point into the bull's back only about an inch, as an irritant. You hear
the horns tear through the horse's hide; you <i>feel</i> them go through
<i>yourself</i>. Ribs crack; there's a clatter of hoofs, harness, and the rider's
armor; a sudden heave and fall&mdash;disaster!&mdash;and then the bull rushes
away in pursuit of a yellow mantle flourished to distract him.</p>

<p>The banderilleros come, each holding two ornamental barbed sticks,
which he waves to attract the bull. At the brute's advance he runs to
meet him, and in the moment when the huge head is lowered for a
lunge, he plants them deftly, one on each shoulder, and springs aside.
Perhaps, getting too near, he fails, and turns to fly; the bull after,
within a few inches. He flees to the barrier, drops his cloak on the
sand, and vaults over; the bull springs over too into the narrow alley;
whereupon the fighter, being close pressed, leaps back into the ring
light as a bird, but saved by a mere hair's-breadth from a tossing or
a trampling to death. The crowd follow every turn with shouts and
loud comments and cheers: "Go, bad little bull!" "Let the picadores
charge!" "More horses! more horses!" "Well done, Gallito!" "Time
for the death!&mdash;the matadores!" and so on. Humor mingles with some
of their remarks, and there is generally one volunteer buffoon who,
choosing a lull in the combat, shrieks out rude witticisms that bring
the laugh from a thousand throats.</p>

<p>But if the management of the sport be not to their liking, then the
multitude grow instantly stormy: rising on the benches, they bellow
their opinions to the president, whistle, stamp, scream, gesticulate. It<a name="page_030" id="page_030"></a>
is the tumult of a mob, appeasable only by speedier bloodshed. And
what bloodshed they get! A horse or two, say, lies lifeless and crumpled
on the earth; the others, with bandaged eyes, and sides hideously
pierced and red-splashed, are spurred and whacked with long sticks to
make them go. But it is time for the banderilleros, and after that for
the swordsman. He advances, glittering, with a proud, athletic step,
the traditional chignon fastened to his pigtail, and holding out his bare
sword, makes a brief speech to the president: "I go to slay this bull for
the honor of the people of Madrid and the most excellent president of
this tourney." Then throwing his hat away, he proceeds to his task of
skill and danger. It is here that the chief gallantry of the sport begins.
With a scarlet cloak in one hand he attracts the bull, waves him to one
side or the other, baffles him, re-invites him&mdash;in fine, plays with and controls
him as if he were a kitten, though always with eye alert and often
in peril. At last, having got him "in position," he lifts the blade, aims,
and with a forward spring plunges it to the hilt at a point near the top
of the spine. Perhaps the bull recoils, reels, and dies with that thrust;
but more often he is infuriated, and several strokes are required to finish
him. Always, however, the blood gushes freely, the sand is stained
with it, and the serried crowd, intoxicated by it, roar savagely. Still,
the "many-headed beast" is fastidious. If the bull be struck in such a
way as to make him spout his life out at the nostrils, becoming a trifle
<i>too</i> sanguinary, marks of disapproval are freely bestowed. One bull
done for, the music recommences, and mules in showy trappings are
driven in. They are harnessed to the carcasses, and the dead bulks of
the victims are hauled bravely off at a gallop, furrowing the dirt. The
grooms run at topmost speed, snapping their long whips; the dust rises
in a cloud, enveloping the strange cavalcade. They disappear through
the gate flying, and you wake from a dream of ancient Rome and her
barbarous games come true again. But soon the trumpets flourish;
another bull comes; the same finished science and sure death ensue,
varied by ever-new chances and escapes, until afternoon wanes, the sun
becomes shadow, and ten thousand satisfied people&mdash;mostly men in felt
sombreros, with some women, fewer ladies, and a sprinkling of children
and babies&mdash;throng homeward.</p>

<p>What impresses is the cold blood of the thing. People bring their
goat-skins of wine, called "little drunkards," and pass them around to
friends, between bulls; others pop off lemonade bottles, and nearly all
smoke. Even a combatant sometimes lights a cigar while the bull is
occupied at the other side of the ring. During the hottest encounters<a name="page_031" id="page_031"></a>
grooms come in to strip the harness from dying horses or stab an incapacitated
one; to carry off baskets of entrails, and rake fresh sand over
the blood-pools, quite calmly, at the risk of sharp interruption from
the vagarious horned enemy. In the midst of a dangerous flurry, while
performers are escaping, an orange-vender in the lane outside the barrier
pitches some fruit to a buyer half-way up the <i>gradas</i>, counting
aloud, "One, two, three," to twenty-four. All are caught, and he neatly
catches his money in return. Afterward, when a bull leaps the barrier,
this intrepid merchant has to fly for life, leaving his basket on the
ground, where the bewildered animal upsets it, rolling the contents
everywhere in golden confusion. Another time we saw a horse and
rider lifted bodily on the horns, and so tossed that the horseman flew
out of his saddle, hurtled through the air directly over the bull, and
landed solidly on his back, senseless. Six grooms bore him off, white
and rigid. But the populace never heeded him; they were madly
cheering the bull's prowess. A surgeon, by-the-way, always attends in
an anteroom; prayers are said before the fight; and a priest is in
readiness with the consecrated wafer to give the last sacrament in case
of any fatal accident. The utter simple-mindedness with which Spaniards
regard the brutalities of the sport may be judged from the fact
that a bull-fight was once given to benefit the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals!</p>

<p>On occasion, the drawing of a charitable lottery is held at the <i>Corrida
de Toros</i>, and then there are gala features. The Queen and various
high-born ladies present magnificent rosettes of silk or satin and gold
and silver tinsel, with long streamers, to be attached by little barbs
to the bulls before their entrance, each having his colors indicated in
this way; and these ornaments are displayed in shop windows for days
before the event. The language of the ring is another peculiarity.
There are many fine points of merit, distinguished by as many canting
terms. There is the "pair regular," the "relance," the "cuartos," and
the darts are playfully termed "shuttlecocks;" the swordsman deals in
"pinches" and "thrusts," and so on&mdash;all of which is recorded in press
reports, amusing enough in their airy and supercilious half-literary
treatment. These are among the most polished products of Spanish
journalism. Fines are imposed on the performers for any achievement
not "regular;" and, on the other hand, good strokes are rewarded by the
public with cigars, or, as the dainty reporters say, they "merit palms."
The three chief swordsmen are Lagartijo, Frascuelo, and Currito;
"Broad Face," "Little Fatty," and the like, being lesser lights. Frascuelo<a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a>
is so renowned for hardihood that I once saw him receive, in
obedience to popular will, the ear of the bull he had just slain&mdash;a supreme
mark of favor.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Madrid is now the head-quarters of the national game, as it is of
everything else. It is outwardly flourishing, it is adorned with statues,
its parks are green, and its fountains spout gayly. Nevertheless, the
impression it makes is melancholy. Beggary is importunate on its public
ways. Palaces and poverty, great wealth and wretched penury, are<a name="page_033" id="page_033"></a>
huddled close together. Its assumption of splendor is in startling contrast
with the desolate and uncared-for districts that surround it from
the very edge of the city outward. The natural result of extremes in
the distribution of property, with a country impoverished, is public
bankruptcy; and public bankruptcy stares surely enough through the
city's gay mask. There is another unhappy result from the undue concentration
of resources at this artificial capital. Madrid prides itself on
being the spot at which all the avenues of the land converge equally,
the exact centre of Spain being close beyond the city's confines, and
marked&mdash;how appropriately&mdash;by a church! But Madrid is, notwithstanding,
a national centre only in name. It enjoys a false luxury, while
too many outlying provinces sustain a starveling existence. And, seeing
the alien, imitative manners adopted here, one feels sharply the
difficult contrasts that exist between the metropolis and the provinces:
no hearty bond of national unity appears. We looked back over the
ground we had traversed, and thought of the gray bones of Burgos
cathedral, lying like some stranded mammoth of another age, far in the
north. Oh, bells of Burgos, mumbling in your towers, what message
have you for these sophisticated ears? And what intelligible response
does the heart of the country send back to you?</p>

<p>"Come," said I to Velveteen. "It is useless to resist longer. Let's
surrender to these two white-capped guards who have dogged us so,
and be carried away."</p>

were speaking, and "What," I asked, "have we
given her in return for her discovery of our
New World?"</p>

<p>"The sleeping-car and the
street tramway," answered
Velveteen, with justifiable
pride.</p>

<p>He was right; for
we had seen the first
on the railroad, and
the second skimming
the streets of Madrid.
Still, the reward did
not appear great, measured
by the much
that Spain's ventures
in the Western
hemisphere had
cost her, and by the comparative
desolation of her present.
The devoted labors of Irving and Prescott,
which Spaniards warmly appreciate, are more
in the nature of an adequate return.</p>

<p>"It strikes me, also," I ventured to add, "that we are rendering
a service in kind. She discovered us, and now we are discovering her."</p>

<p>If one reflects how some of the once great and powerful places of
the Peninsula, such as Toledo and Cordova, have sunk out of sight
and perished to the modern world, this fancy applies with some truth
to every sympathetic explorer of them. It had been all very well to<a name="page_035" id="page_035"></a>
imagine ourselves conversant with the country when we were in Madrid,
and even an occasional slip in the language did not disturb that
supposition. When I accidentally asked the chamber-maid to swallow
a cup of chocolate instead of "bringing" it, owing to an unnecessary
resemblance of two distinct words, and when my comrade, in attending
to details of the laundry, was led by an imperfect dictionary to
describe one article of wear as a <i>pintura de noche</i>, or "night scene,"
our confidence suffered only a momentary shock. But, after all, it
was not until we reached Toledo that we really passed into a kind
of forgotten existence, and knew what it was to be far beyond reach
of any familiar word.</p>

<p>With the first plunge southward from the capital the reign of ruin
begins&mdash;ruin and flies. The heat becomes intense; the air itself seems
to be cooked through and through; the flies rejoice with a malicious
joy, and the dry sandy hills, bearing nothing but tufts of blackened
weeds, resemble large mounds of pepper and salt. Here and there in
the valley is the skeleton of a stone or brick farm-house withering
away, and perhaps near by a small round defensive hut, recalling times
of disorder. Between the hills, however, are fields still prolific in rye,
though wholly destitute of trees. Verdure re-asserts itself wherever<a name="page_036" id="page_036"></a>
there is the smallest water-course; and a curve of the river Tagus is
sure to infold fruit orchards and melon vines, while the parched soil
briefly revives and puts forth delightful shade-trees. But although
the river-fed lands around Toledo are rich in vegetation, the ancient
city itself, with the Tagus slung around its base like a loop, rises on
a sterile rock, and amid hills of bronze. So much are the brown and
sun-imbued houses and the old fortified walls in keeping with the
massy natural foundation that all seem reared together, the huge form
of the Alcazar, or castle&mdash;where the Spanish national military academy
is housed&mdash;towering like a second cliff in one corner of the round,
irregularly clustered city. Our omnibus scaled the height by a road
perfectly adapted for conducting to some dragon stronghold of misty
fable, and landed us in the Zocodover, the sole open space of any
magnitude in that tangle of thread-like streetlets, along which the
houses range themselves with a semblance of order purely superficial.
Most of Toledo is traversable
only for pedestrians and donkeys.
These latter carry immense
double baskets across
their backs, in which are transported
provisions, bricks, coal,
fowls, water, bread, crockery&mdash;everything,
in short, down to
the dirt occasionally scraped
from the thoroughfares. I saw
one peasant, rather advanced
in years, helping himself up
the steep rise of a street on
the hill-side by means of a
stout cane in one hand and
the tail of his heavy-laden
donkey grasped in the other.
To make room for these useful
beasts and their broad panniers, some of the houses are hollowed
out at the corners; in one case the side wall being actually grooved
a foot deep for a number of yards along an anxious turning. Otherwise
the panniers would touch both sides of the way, and cause a
blockade as obstinate as the animal itself.</p>

<p>Coming from the outer world into so strange a labyrinth, where
there is no echo of rolling wheels, no rumble of traffic or manufacture,<a name="page_038" id="page_038"></a><a name="page_039" id="page_039"></a><a name="page_037" id="page_037"></a>
you find yourself in a city which may be said to be without a voice.
Through a hush like this, history and tradition speak all the more
powerfully. Toledo has been a favorite with the novelists. The Zocodover
was the haunt of that typical rogue Lazarillo de Tormes; and
Cervantes, oddly as it happens, connects the scene of <i>La ilustre Fregonde</i>
with a shattered castle across the river, which by a coincidence
has had its original name of San Servando corrupted into San Cervantes.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget our walk around the city walls that first afternoon
in Toledo. A broad thoroughfare skirts the disused defences
on the south and west, running at first along the sheer descent to the
river, and a beetling height against which houses, shops, and churches
are crammed confusedly. I noticed one smithy with a wide dark mouth
revealing the naked rock on which walls and roof abutted, and other
houses into the faces of which had been wrought large granite projections
of the hill. After this the way led through a gate of peculiar
strength and shapeliness, carrying up arches of granite and red brick
to a considerable height&mdash;a stout relic of the proud Moorish dominion
so long maintained here; and then, when we had rambled about a
church of Santiago lower down, passing through some streets irregular
as foot-paths, where over a neglected door stood a unique announcement
of the owner's name&mdash;"I am Don Sanchez. 1792"&mdash;we came
to the Visagra, the country gate. This menacing, double-towered portal
is mediæval; so that a few steps had carried us from Mohammedan
Alimaymon to the Emperor Charles V. Just outside of it again is the
Alameda, the modern garden promenade, where the beauty and idleness
of Toledo congregate on Sunday evenings to the soft compulsion
of strains from the military academical band. Thin runnels of water
murmur along through the hedges and embowered trees, explaining
by their presence how this refreshing pleasure-ground was conjured
into being; for on the slope, a few feet below the green hedges, you
still see the sun-parched soil just as it once spread over the whole area.
The contrast suggests Eden blossoming on a crater-side.</p>

<p>At the open-air soirées of the Alameda may be seen excellent examples
of Spanish beauty. The national type of woman appears here
in good preservation, and not too much hampered by foreign airs.
Doubtless one finds it too in Burgos and Madrid, and in fact everywhere;
and the grace of the women in other places is rather fonder
of setting itself off by a fan used for parasol purposes in the street
than in Toledo. But on the <i>pasco</i> and <i>alameda</i> all Spanish ladies carry<a name="page_040" id="page_040"></a>
fans, and it is something marvellous to see how they manage them.
Not for a moment is the subtle instrument at rest: it flutters, wavers
idly, is opened and shut in the space of a second, falls to the side, and
again rises to take its part in the conversation almost like a third person&mdash;all
without effort&mdash;with merely a turn of the supple fingers or
wrist, and contributing an added charm to the bearer. The type of
face which beams with more or less similarity above every fan in Spain
is difficult to describe, and at first difficult even to apprehend. One
has heard so much about its beauty that in the beginning it seems to
fall short; but gradually its spell seizes on the mind, becoming stronger
and stronger. The tint varies from tawny rose or olive to white:
ladies of higher caste, from their night life and rare exposure to the
sun, acquire a deathly pallor, which is unfortunately too often imitated
with powder. Chestnut or lighter hair is seen a good deal in the south
and east, but deep black is the prevalent hue. And the eyes!&mdash;it is
impossible to more than suggest the luminous, dreamy medium in
which they swim, so large, dark, and vivid. But, above all, there is
combined with a certain child-like frankness a freedom and force, a
quick mobility in the lines of the face, equalled only in American
women. To these elements you must add a strong arching eyebrow
and a pervading richness and fire of nature in the features, which it
would be hard to parallel at all, especially when the whole is framed
in the seductive folds of the black mantilla, like a drifting night-cloud
enhancing the sparkle of a star.</p>

<p>As we continued along the Camin de Marchan we looked down on
one side over the fertile plain. The pale tones of the ripe harvest
and dense green of trees contrasted with the rich brown and gray of
the city, and dashes of red clay here and there. In a long field rose
detached fragments of masonry, showing at different points the vast
ground-plan of the Roman Circus Maximus, with a burst of bright
ochre sand in the midst of the stubble, while on the left hand we had
an old Arab gate pierced with slits for arrows, and on the crest above
that a nunnery&mdash;St. Sunday the Royal&mdash;followed by a line of palaces
and convents half ruined in the Napoleonic campaign of 1812. Out
in the plain was the roof of the sword factory where "Toledo blades"
are still forged and tempered for the Spanish army; although in the
finer details of damascening and design nothing is produced beyond
a small stock of show weapons and tiny ornamental trinkets for sale
to tourists. Nor was this all; for a little farther on, at the edge of
the river, close to the Bridge of St. Martin and the Gate of Twelve<a name="page_041" id="page_041"></a>
Stones, the broken remains of an old Gothic palace sprawled the
steep, lying open to heaven and vacant as the dull eye-socket in some
unsepulchred skull. Our stroll of a mile had carried us back to the
second century before Christ, the path being strewn with relics of the
Roman conquest, the Visigothic inroad, the Moorish ascendency, and
the returning tide of Christian power. But the Jews, seeking refuge
after the fall of Jerusalem, preceded all these, making a still deeper
substratum in the marvellous chronicles of Toledo; and some of their
later synagogues, exquisitely wrought in the Moorish manner, still
stand in the Jewish quarter for the wonderment of pilgrim connoisseurs.</p>

<p>It was from a terrace of this old Gothic palace near the bridge
that, according to legend, Don Roderick, the last of the Goths in
Spain, saw Florinda, daughter of one Count
Julian, bathing in the yellow Tagus under
a four-arched tower which still invades the
flood, and goes by the name of the Bath of
Florinda. From his passion for her, and
their mutual error, the popular tale, with vigorous
disregard of chronology, deduces the
fall of Spain before the Berber armies; and
as most old stories here receive an ecclesiastical
tinge, this one relates how Florinda's
sinful ghost continued to haunt the spot
where we now stood, until laid by a good
friar with cross and benediction. The sharp
fall of the bank at first glance looked to
consist of ordinary earth and stones, but on
closer scrutiny turned out to contain quantities
of brick bits from the old forts and
towers which one generation after another
had built on the heights, and which had
slowly mouldered into nullity. Even so the
firm lines of history have fallen away and
crumbled into romance, which sifts through
the crannies of the whole withered old city.
As a lady of my acquaintance graphically
said, it seems as if ashes had been thrown over this ancient capital,
covering it with a film of oblivion. The rocks, towers, churches, ruins,
are just so much corporeal mythology&mdash;object, lessons in fable. A<a name="page_042" id="page_042"></a>
little girl, becomingly neckerchiefed, wandered by us while we leaned
dreaming above the river; and she was singing one of the wild little
songs of the country, full of melancholy melody:</p>

<p class="nind">All unconscious of the monuments around her, she stopped when she
saw that we had turned and were listening. Then we resumed our
way, passing, I may literally say, as if in a trance up into the town
again, where we presently found ourselves in front of St. John of the
Kings, a venerable church, formerly connected with a Franciscan monastery
which the French burnt. On the outer wall high up hangs a
stern fringe of chains, placed there as votive tokens by released Christian
captives from Granada, in 1492; and there they have remained
since America was discovered!</p>

<p>
To this church is attached a most beautiful cloister, calm with the<br />
solitude of nearly four hundred years. Around three sides the rich<br />
clustered columns, each with its figures of holy<br />
men supported under pointed canopies, mark the<br />
delicate Gothic arches, through which the sunlight<br />
slants upon the pavement, falling between<br />
the leaves of aspiring vines that twine upward<br />
from the garden in the middle. There the rose-laurel<br />
blooms, and a rude fountain perpetually<br />
gurgles, hidden in thick greenery; and on the<br />
fourth side the wall is dismantled as the French<br />
bombardment left it. Seventy years have passed,<br />
and though the sculptured blocks for restoration<br />
have been got together, the vines grow over them,<br />
and no work has been done. We mounted the<br />
bell-tower part way with the custodian, and gained<br />
a gallery looking into the chapel, strangely adorned with regal shields<br />
and huge eagles in stone. On our way, under one part of the tower<br />
roof, we found a hen calmly strutting with her brood. "It was meant<br />
for celibacy," said the custodian, "but times change, and you see that<br />
family life has established itself here after all."<br />

<p>I don't know whether there is anything particularly sacred about
the hens of this district, but after seeing this one in the church-tower
I began to think there might be, especially as on the way home we
discovered another imprisoned fowl disconsolately looking down at us
from the topmost window of a venerable patrician residence.<a name="page_044" id="page_044"></a></p>

<p>I<small>TS</small> antiquities are not the queerest thing about Toledo. The sights<br />
of the day, the isolated existence of the inhabitants, are things peculiar.<br />
The very sports of the children reflect the prevailing influences. A<br />

slow step and droning chants, in imitation of church festivals; and in<a name="page_045" id="page_045"></a><br />

off their coats to wave as mantles before the bull, who<br />

antagonists&mdash;something I should have been glad to see<br />
in the real arena. Once the old rock town accommodated<br />
two hundred thousand residents. Its contingent<br />

day we wandered through a<br />

a paved opening with<br />
a carved wood gallery running<br />
around the walls above.<br />
Orange-trees in tubs stood<br />
about, and a brewery was<br />
established in these palatial<br />
quarters. We ordered a bottle,<br />
but I noticed that the<br />
brewer stood regarding us<br />
anxiously. At last he drew<br />
nearer, and asked, "Do you<br />
come from Madrid?"<br />
<br />
"Yes."<br />
<br />
"Ah, then," said he, in<br />
a disheartened tone, "you<br />
won't like our beer."<br />

<p>We encouraged him, however, and at last he disappeared, sending us<br />
the beverage diplomatically by another hand. He was too faint-spirited<br />
to witness the trial himself. Though called<br />
"The Delicious," the thin, sweet, gaseous liquid<br />
was certainly detestable; but in deference to the<br />
brewer's delicate conscientiousness we drank as<br />
much as possible, and then left with his wife some<br />
money and a weakly complimentary remark about<br />
the beer, which evidently came just in time to<br />
convince her that we were, after all, discriminating<br />
judges.<br />

<p>The people generally were very simple and
good-natured, and in particular a young commercial
traveller from Barcelona whom we met
exerted himself to entertain us. The chief street
was lined with awnings reaching to the curb-stone
in front of the shops, and every public door-way
was screened by a striped curtain. Pushing
aside one of these, our new acquaintance introduced
us to what seemed a dingy bar, but, by a
series of turnings, opened out into a spacious concealed
café&mdash;that of the Two Brothers&mdash;where we
frequently repaired with him to sip chiccory and
cognac or play dominos. On these occasions he kept the tally in pencil
on the marble table, marking the side of himself and a friend with their
initials, and heading ours "The Strangers." All travellers in Spain
are described by natives as "Strangers" or "French," and the reputation
for a pure Parisian accent which we acquired under these circumstances,
though brief, was glorious. To the Two Brothers resorted
many soldiers, shop-keepers, and well-to-do housewives during fixed
hours of the afternoon and evening, but at other times it was as forsaken
as Don Roderick's palace. Another place of amusement was the
Grand Summer Theatre, lodged within the ragged walls of a large building
which had been half torn down. Here we sat under the stars, luxuriating
in the most expensive seats (at eight cents per head), surrounded
by a full audience of exceedingly good aspect, including some Toledan
ladies of great beauty, and listened to a <i>zarzuela</i>, or popular comic
opera, in which the prompter took an almost too energetic part. The
ticket collector came in among the chairs to receive everybody's coupons
with very much the air of being one of the family; for while<a name="page_047" id="page_047"></a><a name="page_048" id="page_048"></a><a name="page_049" id="page_049"></a>
performing
his stern duty he smoked a short brier pipe, giving to the act
an indescribable dignity which threw the whole business of the tickets
into a proper subordination. In returning to our inn about midnight
we were attracted by the free cool sound of a guitar duet issuing from
a dark street that rambled off somewhere like a worm track in old wood,
and, pursuing the sound, we discovered by the aid of a match lighted
for a cigarette two men standing in the obscure alley, and serenading
a couple of ladies in a balcony, who positively laughed with pride at the
attention. The men, it proved, had been hired by some admirer, and
so our friend engaged them to perform for us at the hotel the following
night.</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<br />
<span class="caption">THE SERENADERS.</span>
</p>

<p>The skill these thrummers of the guitar display is delicious, especially
in the treble part, which is executed on a smaller species of the instrument,
called a <i>mandura</i>. Our treble-player was blind in one eye, and
with the carelessness of genius allowed his mouth to stay open, but
managed always to keep a cigarette miraculously hanging in it; while
his comrade, with a disconsolate expression, disdained to look at the
strings on which his proud Castilian fingers were condemned to play a
mere accompaniment. For two or three hours they rippled out those
peculiar native airs which go so well with the muffled vibrations and
mournful Oriental monotony of the guitar; but the bagman varied the
concert by executing operatic pieces on a hair-comb covered with thin
paper&mdash;a contrivance in which he took unfeigned delight. Some remonstrance
against this uproar being made by other inmates of the
hotel, our host silenced the complainants by cordially inviting them in.
One large black-bearded guest, the exact reproduction of a stately ancient
Roman, accepted the hospitality, and listened to that ridiculous
piping of the comb with profound gravity and unmoved muscles, expressing
neither approval nor dissatisfaction. But the white-aproned
waiter, who, though unasked, hung spellbound on the threshold, was,
beyond question, deeply impressed. The relations of servants with
employers are on a very democratic footing in Spain. We had an admirable
butler at Madrid who used to join in the conversation at table
whenever it interested him, and was always answered with good grace
by the conversationists, who admitted him to their intellectual repast
at the same moment that he was proffering them physical nutriment.
These Toledan servitors of the Fonda de Lino were still more informal.
They used to take naps regularly twice a day in the hall, and could not
get through serving dinner without an occasional cigarette between the
<a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a>courses. To save labor, they would place a pile of plates in front of
each person, enough to hold the entire list of viands. That last phrase
is a euphemism, however, for the meal each day consisted of the same
meat served in three separate relays without vegetables, followed by
fowl, an allowance of beans, and dessert. Even this they were not particular
to give us on the hour. Famished
beyond endurance, one evening at eight
o'clock, we went down-stairs and found
that not the first movement toward dinner
had been made. The <i>mozos</i> (waiters)
were smoking and gossiping in the street,
and rather frowned upon our vulgar desire
for food, but we finally persuaded them
to yield to it. After we had bought some
tomatoes, and made a salad at dinner, the
management was put on its mettle, and
improved slightly. Fish in this country
is always brought on somewhere in the
middle of dinner, like the German pudding,
and our landlord astonished us by
following the three courses of stewed veal
with sardines, fried in oil and ambuscaded in a mass of boiled green
peppers. After that we forbore to stimulate his ambition any farther.</p>

<p>The hotel guest, however, is on the whole regarded as a necessary
evil&mdash;a nuisance tolerated only because some few of the finest race in
the world can make money out of him. The landlord lived with his
family on the ground-floor, and furnished little domestic tableaux as
we passed in and out; but he never paid any attention to us, and
even looked rather hurt at the intrusion of so many strangers into
his hostelry. Nor did the high-born sewing-women who sat on the
public stairs, and left only a narrow space for other people to ascend
or descend by, consider it necessary to stir in the least for our convenience.
The fonda had more of the old tavern or posada style
about it than most hotels patronized by foreigners. The entrance
door led immediately into a double court, where two or three yellow
equipages stood; and from this the kitchen, storerooms, and stable
all branched off in some clandestine way. Above, at the eaves, these
courts were covered with canvas awnings wrinkled in regular folds on
iron rods&mdash;sheltering covers which remained drawn from the first flood
of the morning sun until after five in the afternoon. Early and late
I used to look down into the inner court, observing the men and<a name="page_051" id="page_051"></a>
women of the household as they dressed fish and silently wrung the
necks of chickens, or sat talking a running stream of nothingness by
the hour, for love of their own glib but uncouth voices. People of
this province intone rather than talk: their sentences are set to distinct
drawling tunes, such as I never before encountered in ordinary
speech, and their thick lisping of all sibilants, combined with the usual
contralto of their voices, gives the language a sonorous burr, for which
one soon acquires a liking. Sunday is the great hair-combing day in
Toledo, if I may judge from the manner in which women carried on
that soothing operation in their door-ways and <i>patios</i>; and in this
inner court below my window one of the servants, sitting on a stone
slab, enjoyed the
double profit of sewing
and of letting a
companion manipulate
her yard-long
locks of jet, while others
sat near, fanning
themselves and chattering.
Another time
a little girl, dark as
an Indian, came there
in the morning to
wash a kerchief at the
stone tank, always
brimming with dirty
water; after which
she executed, unsuspicious
of my gaze, a
singularly weird <i>pas
seul</i>, a sort of shadow
dance, on the pavement,
and then vanished.</p>

<p>All the houses are
roofed with heavy
curved tiles, which fit
together so as to let the air circulate under their hollow grooves; and
a species of many-seeded grass sprouts out of these baked earth coverings,
out of the ledges of old towers and belfries, and from the<a name="page_052" id="page_052"></a>
crevices of the great cathedral itself, like the downy hair on an old
woman's cheek.</p>

<p>The view along almost any one of the ancient streets, which are
always tilted by the hilly site, is wonderfully quaint in its irregularities.
Every window is heavily grated with iron, from the top to the bottom
story, even the openings high up in the cathedral spire being similarly
guarded, until the whole place looks like a metropolis of prisons. In
the stout doors, too, there are small openings or peep-holes, such as
we had seen still in actual use at Madrid&mdash;the relics of an epoch when
even to open to an unknown visitor might be dangerous. White,
white, white the sunshine!&mdash;and the walls of pink or yellow-brown, of
pale green and blue, are sown with deep shadows and broken by big
archways, often surmounted by rich knightly escutcheons. Balconies
with tiled floors turning their colors down toward the sidewalk stud
the fronts, and long curtains stream over them like cloaks fluttering
in the breeze. At one point a peak-roofed tower rises above the rest
of its house with sides open to the air and cool shadow within, where
perhaps a woman sits and works behind a row of bright flowering
plants. Doves inhabited the fonda roof unmolested by the spiritless
cats that, flat as paper, slept in the undulations of the tiles; for the
Toledan cats and dogs are the most wretched of their kind. They
get even less to eat than their human neighbors, which is saying a
great deal. And beyond the territory of the doves my view extended
to a slender bell-spire at the end of the cathedral, poised in the bright
air like a flower-stalk, with one bell seen through an interstice as if it
were a blossom. At another point the main spire rose out of what
might be called a rich thicket of Gothic work. Its tall thin shaft is
encircled near the point with sharp radiating spikes of iron, doubtless
intended to recall the crown of thorns: in this sign of the Passion,
held forever aloft, three hundred feet above the ground, there is a
penetrating pathos, a solemn beauty.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> cathedral of Toledo, long the seat of the Spanish primate,
stands in the first rank of cathedrals, and is invested with a ponderous
gloom that has something almost savage about it. For six centuries
art, ecclesiasticism, and royal power lavished their resources upon it;
and its dusky chapels are loaded with precious gems and metals, tawdry
though the style of their ornamentation often is. The huge pillars<a name="page_053" id="page_053"></a>
that divide its five naves rise with a peculiar inward curve, which
gives them an elastic look of growth. They are the giant roots from
which the rest has spread. Under the golden gratings and jasper
steps of the high altar Cardinal Mendoza lies buried, with a number
of the older kings of Spain, in a grewsome sunless vault; but at the
back of the altar there is contrived with theatrical effect a burst of
white light from a window in the arched ceiling, around the pale radiance
of which are assembled painted figures, gradually giving place
to others in veritable relief&mdash;all sprawling, flying, falling down the wall
enclosing the altar, as if one were suddenly permitted to see a swarm
of saints and angels careering in a beam of real supernatural illumination.
A private covered gallery leads above the street from the
archbishop's palace into one side of the mighty edifice; and this, with
the rambling, varied aspect of the exterior, in portions resembling a
fortress, with a stone sentry-box on the roof, recalls the days of prelates
who put themselves at the head of armies, leading in war as in
everything else. A spacious adjoining cloister,
full of climbing ivy and figs, Spanish cypress,
the smooth-trunked laurel-tree, and many other
growths, all bathed in opulent sunshine, marks
the site of an old Jewish market, which Archbishop
Tenorio in 1389 incited a mob to burn
in order that he might have room for this sacred
garden. But the voices of children now ring out
from the upper rooms of the cloister building,
where the widows and orphans of cathedral servants
are given free homes. Through this "cloister
of the great church" it was that Cervantes
says he hurried with the MS. of Cid Hamete
Benengeli, containing Don Quixote's history, after he had bought it
for half a real&mdash;just two cents and a half.</p>

<p>A temple of the barbaric and the barbarous, the cathedral dates
from the thirteenth century: but it was preceded by one which was
built to the Virgin in her lifetime, tradition says, and she came down
from heaven to visit her shrine. The identical slab on which she
alighted is still preserved in one of the chapels. A former inscription
said to believers, "Use yourselves to kiss it for your much consolation,"
and their obedient lips have in time greatly worn down the
stone. Later on, the church was used as a mosque by the infidel
conquerors, and when they were driven out it was pulled down to be<a name="page_054" id="page_054"></a>
replaced by the present huge and solemn structure. But, by a compromise
with the subjugated Moors, a Muzarabic mass (a seeming mixture
of Mohammedan ritual with Christian worship) was ordained to
be said in a particular chapel; and there it is recited still, every morning
in the year. I attended this weird, half-Eastern ceremony, which
was conducted with an extraordinary incessant babble of rapid prayer
from the priests in the stalls, precisely like the inarticulate hum one
imagines in a mosque. On the floor below and in front of the altar-steps
was placed a richly-draped chest, perhaps meant to represent
the tomb of Mohammed in the Caaba, and around it stood lighted
candles. During the long and involved mass one of the younger
priests, in appearance almost an imbecile, had the prayer he was to
read pointed out for him by an altar-boy with what looked like a
long knife-blade, used for the purpose. Soon after an incense-bearing
acolyte nudged him energetically to let him know that his turn had
now come. This was the only evidence I could discover of any progress
in knowledge or goodness resulting from the Muzarabic mass.</p>

<p>At one time Toledo had, besides the cathedral, a hundred and ten
churches. Traces of many of them are still seen in small arches rising
from the midst of house-tops, with a bell swung in the opening; but
the most have fallen into disuse, and the greatest era of the hierarchy
has passed. The great priests have also passed, and those who now
dwell here offer to the most unprejudiced eye a dreary succession of
bloated bodies and brutish faces. Sermons are never read in the gorgeous
cathedral pulpits, and the Church, as even an ardent Catholic
assured me, seems, at least locally, dead. The priests and the prosperous
shop-keepers are almost the only beings in Toledo who look
portly; the rest are thin, brown, wiry, and tall, with fine creases in their
hard faces that appear to have been drilled there by the sand-blast
process.</p>

<p>The women, however, even in the humbler class, preserve a fine,
fresh animal health, which makes you wonder how they ever grow old,
until you see some tottering creature who is little more than a mass of
sinews and wrinkles held together by a skirt and a neckerchief&mdash;the
<i>pañuclo</i> universal with her sex. At noon and evening the serving-women
came out to the fountains, distributed here and there under
groups of miniature locust-trees, to fetch water for their houses. They
carried huge earthen jars, or <i>cantarones</i>, which they would lug off easily
under one arm, in attitudes of inimitable grace.</p>

<p>If religious sway over temporal things has declined, Toledo still<a name="page_055" id="page_055"></a><a name="page_056" id="page_056"></a><a name="page_057" id="page_057"></a>
impresses one as little more than a big church founded on the rock,
with room made for the money-changers' benches, and an unimaginable
jumble of palaces once thronged with powerful courtiers and abundant
in wealth, but at this day chiefly inhabited by persons of humble
quality. Nightly there glows in
the second story of a building
on the Zocodover, where <i>autos-da-fé</i>
used to be held, a large
arched shrine of the Virgin hung
with mellow lamps, so that not
even with departing daylight
shall religious duty be put aside
by the commonplace crowd
shuffling through the plaza beneath.
Everywhere in angles
and turnings and archways one
comes upon images and pictures
fixed to the wall under a pointed
roof made with two short boards,
to draw a passing genuflection
or incidental <i>ave</i> from any one
who may be going by on an
errand of business or&mdash;as more
often occurs&mdash;laziness. Feast-days,
too, are still ardently observed.
With all this, somehow,
the fact connects itself that the
populace are instinctive, free-born,
insatiable beggars. The
magnificently chased door-ways
of the cathedral festered with
revolting specimens of human
disease and degeneration, appealing
for alms. Other more
prosperous mendicants were regularly
on hand for business every
day at the "old stand" in
some particular thoroughfare. I
remember one, especially, whose
whole capital was invested in a superior article of nervous complaint,<a name="page_058" id="page_058"></a>
which enabled him to balance himself between the wall and a crutch,
and there oscillate spasmodically by the hour. In this he was entirely
beyond competition, and cast into the shade those merely routine professionals
who took the common line of bad eyes or uninterestingly
motionless deformities. It used to depress them when he came on to
the ground. Bright little children, even, in perfect health, would desist
from their amusements
and assail us,
struck with the happy
thought that they
might possibly wheedle
the "strangers"
into some untimely
generosity. There was
one pretty girl of about
ten years, who laughed
outright at the
thought of her own
impudence, but stopped
none the less for
half an hour on her
way to market (carrying
a basket on her
arm) in order to pester
poor Velveteen
while he was sketching,
and begged him
for money, first to get
bread, and then shoes,
and then anything she
could think of.

<p>My friend's irrepressible pencil, by-the-way, made him the centre of
a crowd wherever he went. Grave business men came out of their shops
to see what he was drawing; loungers made long and ingenious detours
in order to obtain a good view of his labors; ragamuffins elbowed
him, undismayed by energetic remarks in several languages, until finally
he was moved to get up and display the contents of his pockets,
inviting them even to read some letters he had with him. To this gentle<a name="page_059" id="page_059"></a>
satire they would sometimes yield. We fell a prey, however, to one
silent youth of whom we once unguardedly asked a question. After
that he considered himself permanently engaged to pilot us about.
He would linger for hours near the fonda dinnerless, and, what was
even more terrible, sleepless, so that he might fasten upon us the moment
we should emerge. If he discovered our destination, he would
stride off mutely in advance, to impress on us the fact that we were
under obligation to him; and when we found the place we wanted, he
waited patiently until we had rewarded him with a half-cent. If we<a name="page_060" id="page_060"></a>
gratified him by asking him the way, he responded by silently stretching
forth his arm and one long forefinger with a lordly gesture, still
striding on; and he had a very superior Castilian sneering smile, which
he put on when he looked around to see if we were following. He
gradually became for us a sort of symbolic shadow of the town's vanished
greatness; and from his mysterious way of coming into sight, and
haunting us in the most unexpected places, we gave him the name of
"Ghost." Nevertheless, we baffled him at last. In the Street of the
Christ of Light there is a small but exceedingly curious mosque, now
converted into a church, so ancient in origin that some of the capitals
in it are thought to show Visigothic work, so that it must have been a
Christian church even before the Moorish invasion. Close by this we
chanced upon a charming old <i>patio</i>, or court-yard, entered through a
wooden gate, and by dexterously gliding in here and shutting the gate
we exorcised "Ghost" for some time.</p>

<p>The broad red tiles of this <i>patio</i> contrasted well with its white-washed
arcade pillars, on which were embossed the royal arms of Castile;
and the jutting roof of the house was supported on elaborate
beams of old Spanish cedar cracked with age. It was sadly neglected.
Flowers bloomed in the centre, but a pile of lumber littered one side;
and the house was occupied by an old woman who was washing in the
arcade, her tub being the half of a big terra-cotta jar laid on its side.
She spread her linen out on the hot pavement to dry; and a sprightly
neighbor coming in with a basket of clothes and a "Health to thee!"
was invited to dry <i>her</i> wash on a low tile roof adjoining.</p>

<p>"Solitude" served at once as her name and to describe her surroundings.
We made friends with her, the more easily because she
was much interested in the sketch momently growing under my companion's
touch.</p>

<p>"And <i>you</i> don't draw?" she inquired of me.</p>

<p>I answered, apologetically, "No."</p>

<p>Having seen me glancing over a book, she added, as if to console
me, and with emphasis, "But you can read!" To her mind that was
a sister art and an equal one.</p>

<p>She went on to tell how her granddaughter had spent ten years in
school, and at the end of that time was able to read. "But now she is
forgetting it all. She goes out and plays too much with the <i>muchachas</i>"
(young girls).</p>

<p>This amiable grandmother also took us in to see her domicile, which
proved to be a part of the old city wall, and had a fine view from its<a name="page_061" id="page_061"></a><a name="page_062" id="page_062"></a><a name="page_063" id="page_063"></a>
iron-barred window. She declared vaguely that "a count" had formerly
lived there; but it had more probably been the gate-captain's house,
for close by was one of the fortified ports of the inner defences. A
store-room, in fact, which she kept full of pigeons and incredibly miscellaneous
old iron, stood directly over the arched entrance, and there
we saw the heavy beam and windlass which in by-gone ages had hoisted
or let fall the spiked portcullis. I induced "Solitude" to tell me a
legend about one of the churches; for there is generally some story to
every square rod of ground hereabout, and indeed a little basilica below
the town sustains four different narratives all explaining a single
miracle. Serving as an appropriate foundation for local wonder-mongering,
a great cave in the rock underlies some portion of the city, and
is said to have been hollowed out by Hercules, who, in addition to his
other labors, has received the credit of founding Toledo. I am convinced
that no muscles but his could ever have stood the strain of first
climbing its site. The cave I refer to has been for the most part of the
last two hundred years closed and walled up. About thirty years since
it was timidly explored by a society formed for the purpose, and some
Roman remains were found in it; but after that, terror fell upon the
explorers, and the cavern was again closed, remaining even yet a reservoir
of mystery. There are equally mysterious things above ground,
however, as will shortly be demonstrated by the tale of the "Christ of
Compassion." Let me, before giving that, recall here a more poetic
tradition, preserved by Señor Eugenio Olavarria, a young author of
Madrid. We saw just outside the mosque-church of the Christ of
Light an old Moorish well, of a kind common in Spain, with a low
thick wall surrounding the deep sunken shaft, to rest the bucket-chain
on when it is let down and drawn up by sheer muscular force. The
edges were worn into one continuous pattern of grooves by the incessant
chafing of the chains for ages, and we conjured up a dozen romances
about the people who of old slaked their thirst there. It is
about another water-source of the same kind, on a small street still called
Descent to the Bitter Well, that the story here outlined is told:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="c">THE WELL OF BITTERNESS.</p>

<p>"In the time of one of the Moorish kings there lived at Toledo, under
the mild toleration of that epoch, a rich Jew, strictly and passionately
devoted to the laws of his religion and to one only other object: that
one was his daughter Raquel, motherless, but able to solace his widowed
heart with her devoted affection. Sixteen Aprils had wrought their<a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a>
beautiful changes into her exquisite form and lovely mind, till at last,
of all things which they had waked to life, she appeared the fairest.</p>

<p>"Reuben had gradually made her the chief end of his existence, and
she certainly merited this absolute concentration of her father's love.
But, notwithstanding that at this time Jews and Christians dwelt together
unmolested by the Mohammedan rule, the inborn hostility between
these two orders underwent no abatement. Intercourse between
them was sedulously avoided by each, and the springing up of any shy
flower of love between man and maid of such hostile races was sure to
be followed by deadly blight and ruin. Nevertheless&mdash;and how it happened
who can say?&mdash;Raquel, already ripened by the rich sun of her
native land into a perfected womanhood, fell in love with a young
Christian cavalier, who had himself surrendered to her silent and distant
beauty as it shone upon him, while passing, from her grated window
in Reuben's stately mansion. He learned her name, and spoke it
to her from the street&mdash;'Raquel!'&mdash;at twilight. So trembling and
brimming with mutual love were they, that this one word, like the last
o'erflowing drop of precious liquid from a vase, was enough to reveal to
her what filled his heart. As she heard it she blushed as though it had
been a kiss that he had reverently impressed upon her cheek; and this
was answer enough&mdash;their secret and perilous courtship had begun.
Thereafter they met often at night in the great garden attached to the
house, making their rendezvous at the low-walled well that stood in a
thicket of fragrant greenery. At last, through the prying of an aged
friend, his daughter's passion came to the knowledge of old Reuben,
who had never till then even conceived of such disgrace as her being
enamoured of a Christian. His course was prompt and terrible. Concealing
himself one evening behind a tree-trunk close to the well, he
awaited the coming of the daring cavalier, sprung upon him, and after
a short, noiseless struggle bore him down with a poniard in his breast!</p>

<p>"The stealthy opening of a door into the garden warned him of Raquel's
approach. He hastened again into concealment. She arrived, saw
her fallen lover, dropped at his side in agonies of terror, and sought to
revive him. Then she saw and by the moonlight recognized her father's
dagger in the breathless bosom of the young man, and knew what
had happened. Moved by sudden remorse, Reuben came out with words
of consolation ready. But she knew him not, she heard him not; from
that instant madness was in her eyes and brain. Many months she
haunted the spot at night, calm but hopelessly insane, and weeping
silently at the margin of the well, into whose waters her salt tears descended.<a name="page_065" id="page_065"></a>
At length there came a night when she did not return to the
house. She had thrown herself into the well and was found there&mdash;dead!</p>

<p>"Never again could any one drink its waters, which had been famous
for their quality. Raquel's tears of sorrow had turned them bitter."</p>
</div>

<p>The other legend is still more marvellous: "In the reign of Enrique IV.
of Spain there was fierce rivalry between two Toledan families,
the Silvas and the Ayalas, which in 1467 led to open warfare. The
Silvas threw themselves into the castle, and the Ayalas held the cathedral&mdash;the
blood shed in their combats staining the very feet of its altars.
During this struggle of hatred there was also a struggle of love going
on between two younger members of the embroiled families. Diego
de Ayala, setting at naught the pride of his house, had given his heart
to Isabel, the daughter of a poor hidalgo; but it so happened that his
enemy, Don Lope de Silva, had resolved to win the same maiden,
though receiving no encouragement from her. One night when the
combatants were resting on their arms, and the whole city was in disorder,
Don Lope succeeded in entering Isabel's house with several of
his followers and carried her off&mdash;trusting to the general confusion to
prevent interruption. As they were bearing her away across a little
square in front of the Church of San Justo, Don Diego, on his way to
see Isabel, encountered them.</p>

<p>"'Leave that woman, ye cowards, and go your way!' he commanded,
with drawn sword. And at that instant, by the light of the lamp
which burned before the pictured Christ of Compassion on the church
wall, he recognized Isabel and Don Lope.</p>

<p>"Making a bold dash, he succeeded in freeing Isabel and getting her
into the shelter of an angle in the wall, just below the holy figure. But
being there hemmed in by his adversaries, he felt himself, after a sharp
fight in which he dealt numerous wounds, fainting from the severe
thrusts he had himself received. Fearing that he was mortally hurt,
he raised his eyes to the shrine and prayed: 'O God, not for me, but
for her, manifest thy pity! I am willing to die, but save her!'</p>

<p>"Then a marvellous brilliance streamed out from the thorn-crowned
head, and instantly, propelled by some unseen force, Diego found himself
and Isabel pushed through the solid wall behind them, which opened
to receive them into the sanctuary, and closed again to keep out the
assassins. Don Lope rushed forward in pursuit, and in his rage hacked
the stones with his sword as if to cut his way through. The marks<a name="page_066" id="page_066"></a>
made in the stone by his weapon are still to be seen there." The compassionate
face still looks down from the shrine, and little sign-boards
announce indulgences to those who pray there: "Señor Don Luis
Maria de Borbon, most Illustrious Señor Bishop of Carista, grants forty
days' indulgence to all who with grief for their sins say, 'Lord have
mercy on me!' or make the acts of Faith, Charity, and Hope before this
image, praying for the necessities of the Church."</p>

<p>Altogether I computed that a good Catholic could by a half-hour's
industry secure immunity for two hundred and twenty days, or nearly
two-thirds of a year. It is to be feared that the Toledans are too lazy
to profit even by this splendid chance.</p>

<p>The majority of people here who can command a daily income of
ten cents will do no work. Numbers of the inhabitants are always
standing or leaning around drowsily, like animals who have been hired
to personate men, and are getting tired of the job. Every act approaching
labor must be done with long-drawn leisure. Men and boys
slumber out-of-doors even in the hot sun, like dogs; after sitting meditatively
against a wall for a while, one of them will tumble over on his
nose&mdash;as if he were a statue undermined by time&mdash;and remain in motionless
repose wherever he happens to strike. Business with the trading
class itself is an incident, and resting is the essence of the mundane
career.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the place has fits of activity. When the mid-day
siesta is over there is a sudden show of doing something. Men begin
to trot about with a springy, cat-like motion, acquired from always
walking up and down hill, which, taken with their short loose blouses,
dark skins, and roomy canvas slippers, gives them an astonishing likeness
to Chinamen.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The slip and scramble of mule hoofs and donkey
hoofs are heard on the steep pavements, and two or three loud-voiced,
lusty men, with bare arms, carrying a capacious tin can and a dipper,
go roaring through the torrid streets, "Hor-cha-ta!" Then the cathedral
begins wildly pounding its bells, all out of tune, for vespers. The
energy which has broken loose for a couple of hours is discovered to be
a mistake, and another interval of relaxation sets in, lasting through the
night, and until the glare of fiery daybreak, greeted by the shrill whistling
of the remorseless pet quail, sets the insect-like stir going again
for a short time in the forenoon. Because of such apathy, and of a<a name="page_067" id="page_067"></a>
more than the usual Latin disregard for public decency, the streets and
houses are allowed to become pestilential, and drainage is unknown.
Enervating luxury of that sort did well enough for the Romans and
Moors, but is literally below the level of Castilian ideas. In the midst
of the most sublime emotion aroused by the associations or grim beauty
of Toledo, you are sure to be stopped short by some intolerable odor.</p>

<p>The primate city was endowed with enough of color and quaintness
almost to compensate for this. We never tired of the graceful women
walking the streets vestured in garments of barbaric tint and endlessly
varied ornamentation, nor of the men in short breeches split at the bottom,
who seemed to have splashed pots of vari-colored paint at hap-hazard
over their clothes, and insisted upon balancing on their heads broad-brimmed<a name="page_068" id="page_068"></a>,
pointed hats, like a combination of sieve and inverted funnel.
There was a spark of excitement, again, in the random entry of a
"guard of the country," mounted on his emblazoned donkey-saddle,
with a small arsenal in his waist sash, and a couple of guns slung behind
on the beast's flanks, ready for marauders. Even now in remembrance
the blots on Toledo fade, and I see its walls and towers throned grandly
amid those hills that were mingled of white powder and fire at noon-tide,
but near evening cooled themselves down to olive and russet citron,
with burning rosy shadows resting in the depressions.</p>

</p>

<p>One of the first spectacles that presented itself to us will remain
also one of the latest recollections. Between San Juan de los Reyes
and the palace of Roderick we met unexpectedly a crowd of boys and
girls, followed by a few men, all carrying lighted candles that glowed
spectrally, for the sun was still half an hour high in the west. A stout
priest, with white hair and a vinous complexion, had just gone down
the street, and this motley group was following the same direction.<a name="page_069" id="page_069"></a>
Somewhat in advance walked a boy with a small black and white coffin,
held in place on his head by his upraised arm, as if it were a toy; and
in the midst of the candle-bearers moved a light bier like a basket-cradle,
carried by girls, and containing the small waxen form of a dead
child three or four years old, on whose impassive, colorless face the
orange glow of approaching sunset fell, producing an effect natural yet
incongruous. A scampering dog accompanied the mourners, if one
may call them such, for they gave no token of being more impressed,
more touched by emotion, than he. The cradle-bier swayed from side
to side as if with a futile rockaby motion, until the bearers noticed how
carelessly they were conveying it down the paved slope; and the members
of the procession talked to each other with a singular indifference,
or looked at anything which caught their random attention. As the
little rabble disappeared through the Puerta del Cambron, with their
long candles dimly flaming, and the solemn, childish face in their midst,
followed by the poor unconscious dog, it seemed to me that I beheld
in allegory the departure from Toledo of that spirit of youth whose
absence leaves it so old and worn.</p>

/></span></a> House of Purification, as the
great mosque at Cordova was called,
used to be a goal of pilgrimage
for the Moors in Spain, as Mecca
was for Mohammedans elsewhere.
Their shoes no longer repose at its
doors, but other less devout pilgrims
now come in a straggling
procession from all quarters of the
globe to rest a while within its fair
demesne&mdash;hallowed, perhaps, as
much by the unique flowering of a
whole people's genius in shapes of
singular loveliness as by the more
direct religious service to which it
has been dedicated and re-dedicated
under conflicting beliefs.</p>

<p>It was with peculiar eagerness,
therefore, that we set out on our
way. An American who was following the same route had joined us&mdash;a
man with ruddy, bronzed cheeks and iron-gray hair, whom I at first
should have taken for the great-grandson of a Spanish Inquisitor, if such
a thing were possible. His iron persistence and the intensity of his
prejudices were in keeping with that character&mdash;the only trouble being
that the prejudices were all on the wrong side. Whetstone (as he was
called) shared our eagerness in respect of Cordova, though from different
motives. He hailed each new point in his journey with satisfaction,
because it would get him so much nearer the end; for the reason
he had come to Spain was, apparently, to get out of it again. "I don't
see what I came to Spain for," Whetstone would observe to us, dismally;<a name="page_071" id="page_071"></a>
and, for that matter, we could not see either. "If there ever
<i>was</i> a God-forsaken country&mdash;Why, look at the way a whole parcel
of these men at the dinner-table get out their cigarettes and smoke
right there, without ever asking a lady's leave! I'd like to see 'em try
it on at home! Wouldn't they be just snaked out of that room pretty
quick?" He had under his care a young lady of great sensibility, a relative
by marriage, accompanied by her maid; and the maid was a colored
woman of the most pronounced pattern. Altogether our pilgrim party
embraced a good deal of variety. The young American girl, being a
Catholic, was really a palmer faring from shrine to shrine. Rarely a
convent or a chapel escaped her; she sipped them all as if they had
been flower-cups and she a humming-bird, and managed to extract
some unknown honey of comfort from their bitterness. It was like
having a novice with us.</p>

<p>The night journeys by rail, so much in vogue in Spain, have their
advantages and their drawbacks. At Castillejo, a junction on the way to
Cordova, we had to wait four hours in the evening
at a distance of twenty miles from the nearest restaurant.
The country around was absolutely desolate
except for tufts of the <i>retamé</i>&mdash;a sort of broom
with slim green and silvered leaves, which grows
wild, and, after drying, is used by the peasants as a
substitute for rye or wheat flour. Only two or three
houses were in sight. The tracks with cars standing
on them, and the unfinished look of the whole
place, made us feel as if we had by mistake been
carried off to some insignificant railroad station in
Illinois or Missouri. The only resource available
for dinner was a <i>cantineria</i>, or drinking-room, where
a few blocks of tough bread lent respectability to
a lot of loaferish wine-bottles, and some uninviting
sausages were hung in gloomy festoons, with a suspicious
air of being a permanent architectural fixture
intended as a perch for flies. The Spaniards
invent little rhymed proverbs about many of their villages, and of one
insignificant Andalusian hamlet, Brenes, the saying is,
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If to Brenes thou goest,</span>
<span class="ist">Take with thee thy roast."</span>
</div></div>

<p><a name="page_072" id="page_072"></a></p>

<p class="nind">But Castillejo seems to be an equally good subject for this warning.
We recalled how lavishly, on the way to Toledo, we had presented
bread, meat, and strawberries to some country folk who were not in the
habit of eating, and how ardently they had thanked us. As we passed
their house in returning it was closed and lifeless, and we were convinced
that they had died of a surfeit. How willingly would we now
have undone that deed! However, after making some purchases from
an extremely deaf old woman who presided over such poor supplies as
the place afforded, we asked her if she could have coffee prepared. "If
there is enough in the house," she replied to our interrogatory shrieks.
Accordingly, we carried a table out under some trees on the gravel
platform, to eat <i>al fresco</i>.</p>

<p>When we found ourselves in this way for the first time thrown back
on the Spanish sausage, we resisted that unsympathetic substance with
all the vigor of despair. But, aided by some bad wine, an interesting
conversation with the Novice, and the glow of a sunset sky that looked
as if strewn with fading peony petals, we recovered from the shock<a name="page_073" id="page_073"></a>
caused in the beginning by a mingled flavor of garlic, raisins, and pork.
In truth, there was something enjoyable about this wild supper around
which our quartette gathered in the dry, dewless twilight. An ancient
female, resembling a broken-down Medea, came out and kindled a fire
of brushwood beyond the track, swung a kettle there, and cooked our
coffee, bending over the flame-light the while with her scattered gray
tresses, and wailing out doleful <i>peteneras</i>, the popular songs of Spain.
The songs, the fire, the wine, the strange scene, were so stimulating
that we were surprised to find all at once the dark vault overhead full
of stars, the comet staring at us in its flight above the hills, and our
ten-o'clock train nearly due.</p>

<p>The next morning we were in a region totally unlike anything we
had seen before, excepting for the ever-present mountain ranges wild as
the Pyrenees or Guadaramas. The light of dawn on these barren Spanish
mountain-sides, drawn up into peaks as sharp as the points of a
looped-up curtain, produces effects indescribable except on canvas and
by a subtle colorist. The bare surfaces of rock or dry grass and moss,
and the newly reaped harvest fields lower down, blend the tints of air
and earth in a velvet-smooth succession of madder and faint yellow,
olive and rose and gray, fading off into a reddish-violet at greater
distances.</p>

<p>These eminences are a part of the Sierra Morena, where Don
Quixote achieved some of his most noteworthy feats&mdash;the liberation of
the galley-slaves, the descent into the Cave of Montesinos, the capture
of Mambrino's helmet, and the famous penance. So weird is the aspect
of these desolate hills, enclosing silent valleys in which narrow tracts of
woods are harbored, that I suspected it would be easy to breed a few
Don Quixotes of reality there. Craziness would become a necessary
diversion to relieve the monotony of existence.</p>

<p>A winding river-bed near by was bordered by tufted copses of
oleander in full flower, and hedges of huge serrated aloe guarded the
roads. On the hill-sides a round corral for herds would occasionally be
seen. In the fields the time-honored method of threshing out grain by
driving a sort of heavy board sledge in a circle over the cut crop, and
of winnowing by tossing up shovelfuls of the grain-dust into the breezy
air, was in active operation. By-and-by the olive orchards began. As
far as we could see they stretched on either side their ranks of round
dusty green tree-heads. Thousands of acres of them&mdash;one grove after
another: we travelled through fifty miles of almost unbroken olive
plantations, until we fancied we could even smell the fruit on the<a name="page_074" id="page_074"></a>
boughs, and our eyes were sick and weary with the sameness of the
sight. Then the river, which from time to time had shown its muddy
current in curves and sweeps, moving through the land at the bottom
of what might have been an enormous drain, turned out to be the famous
Guadalquivir, which, as Ford vividly puts it, "eats its dull way
through loamy banks." At last Cordova, seated in an ample plain&mdash;Cordova,
in vanished ages the home of Seneca, Lucan, Averroës, and
the poet Juan de Mena&mdash;Cordova, white in the dry and gritty sun-dazzled
air, with square, unshadowed two-story houses, overlooked by the
bell-tower of its incomparable Mezquita Cathedral: a cheerful Southern
city, maintaining large gardens, abounding in palms and myrtles and
orange and lemon trees; possessing, moreover, clean streets of perceptible
width.</p>

<p>After the "interpreter," or hotel guide, the beggar: such is the order
in these Spanish towns, and not seldom the guide is merely a bolder
kind of beggar. Two or three of the most frantically miserable and
loathsome charity-seekers I ever saw surrounded our omnibus as we
awaited our baggage, and stuffed their hideous heads in at the windows<a name="page_075" id="page_075"></a>
and door, concentrating on us their fire of appeals. Velveteen had
heard that the sovereign remedy for these pests was to treat them with
consummate politeness and piety. "Pardon me, brother, for God's
sake!" was the deprecatory formula which had been recommended, and
he now proceeded to recite this, book in hand. Unfortunately it took
him about five minutes to get it launched in good style and pure Spanish,
during which time the beggars had an opportunity entirely to miss
the sense. A few grains of tobacco dropped into the hat of one of
them were more efficacious, for they had the result of mystifying him
and hopelessly paralyzing his analytical powers. Finally the guide,
coming with the baggage, recognized his rivals, and drove them off.<a name="page_076" id="page_076"></a></p>

<p>At several places on the way we had seen our twin military persecutors
waiting for us, sometimes with white havelocks, and again in glazed
hat-covers and capes. "Are they disguising themselves, so as to fall
upon us unawares?" I asked my friend. We determined not to be deceived,
however, by the subtle device. These Spanish police-soldiers
go through more metamorphoses in the linen and water-proof line than
any troops I know. It must be excessively inconvenient to run home
and make the change every time a slight shower threatens; and invariably,
as soon as they get on their storm-cover, the sun begins to shine
again. On our arrival they seemed to have made up their minds to
arrest us at once; they came striding along toward us in duplicate,
one the fac-simile of the other, and we gave ourselves up for lost. But
just as they were within a few paces, their unaccountable policy of delay
caused them to deviate suddenly, and march on as if they hadn't
seen us. "One more escape!" sighed Velveteen, fervently.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the languor which we had left in the middle of
the kingdom, at Toledo, was replaced in this more tropical latitude by
great activity. The shop streets presented a series of rooms entirely
open to the view, where men and women were busily engaged in all
sorts of small manufacture&mdash;shoes, garments, tin-work, carpentering.
They were happy and diligent, as if they had been animated writing-book
maxims, and sung or whistled at their tasks in a most exemplary
manner.</p>

<p>"Cordovan leather" still holds it own, on a petty scale, and the
small cups hammered out of old silver dollars constitute, with filigree
silver-work, a characteristic local product. The faces of the people betrayed
their gypsy blood oftentimes, and there was one street chiefly
occupied by the Romany folk. Traces of blond or light chestnut hair
showed that the Moorish stock had likewise left some offshoots that do
not die out. The whole aspect of Cordova presents at once a reflex of
the refined and enlightened spirit of the ancient caliphate. Everybody,
including most of the beggars, has a fresh and cleanly appearance; the
very priests undergo a change, being frequently more refined in feature
and of a more tolerant expression than those of the North. The women
set off their rosy brown complexions and black hair with clusters of
rayed jasmine blossoms, flattened and ingeniously fixed in rosette form
on long pins. The men, discarding those hot felt hats so obstinately
worn in the central provinces, make a comfortable and festive appearance
in their curling Panamas. On the Street of the Great Captain&mdash;the
chief open-air resort, commemorating Gonsalvo of Cordova, who led<a name="page_077" id="page_077"></a><a name="page_078" id="page_078"></a><a name="page_079" id="page_079"></a>
so ably in the triumphant Christian campaigns&mdash;the people laugh and
chat as if they really enjoyed life. There is a great deal of wealth in
the place, and the lingering atmosphere of its past greatness is not depressing,
as that of Toledo is, for it was never the home of bigotry and
ignorance. Its prosperous epoch under Abdur-rahman and his Ommeyad
successors was one of brilliant civilization. It was then a nursery
of science and the arts; its inhabitants numbered a million. It had
mosques by the hundred, and nearly a thousand baths&mdash;for the Spanish
Moors well knew the civilizing virtue of water, and kept life-giving
streams of it running at the roots of their institutions. The houses of
the modern city are very plain on the exterior, and their common coat
of whitewash imparts to them a democratic equality, though aristocracy
is still a living thing there, instead of having sunk into pitfalls of squalor
and idleness, as in the sombre city by the Tagus.</p>

<p>Gloomy little churches crop out in every quarter, and a few convents
of nuns remain, where you may hear the faint, sad litany of the unseen
sisters murmured behind the grating, while a priest chants service for
them in the lonely chapel. The bells of these churches and of the
mosque-cathedral are hardly ever silent; the brazen jargon of their
tongues echoes over the roofs at all hours, and the hollow, metallic<a name="page_080" id="page_080"></a>
tinkle of mule-bells from the otherwise silent streets at times strikes
one as making response to them. The beauty of the cathedral&mdash;still
called the Mezquita (mosque)&mdash;lies almost solely in the preservation of
its original Moorish architecture.</p>

<p>The site was first occupied as a place of worship by the Roman
Temple of Janus, and this in turn became a basilica of the Gothic<a name="page_081" id="page_081"></a>
Christians. Abdur-rahman, after the Christians had long been allowed
by the caliphs to continue their worship in one half of the basilica,
reared the supremely wonderful House of Purification as it now stands;
and then, after the conquest by Ferdinand and Isabella, in the reign of
Charles V., the cumbrous high altar and choir, which choke up so much
of the interior, transformed it once more into a stronghold of Christian
ceremonial. But when you enter at the Gate of Pardon the long, wide
Court of Oranges, you find yourself transported instantly to Mohammedan
surroundings; you are under the dominion of the Ommeyades.</p>

<p>High walls hem in this open-air vestibule, where rows of orange-trees
rustle their dense foliage in the warm wind. Their trunks are
corpulent with age, for some of them date back to the last Moorish
dynasty, and at one end stands the tank where followers of the Prophet<a name="page_082" id="page_082"></a>
washed themselves before entering in to pray. The Gate of Pardon,
under the high-spired bell-tower, takes its name from the custom which
obtained of giving criminals refuge by its portal. The murderer who
could fly hither and gain the central aisle of the temple, directly opposite
the gate across the court, was safe for shelter by the Mihrab, or
inner shrine, at the farther end of the aisle. All the nineteen aisles
formerly opened from the fragrant garden, though Catholic rule gives
access by only three; but inside one sees at a glance the vast consecrated
space which was so freely open to the Mussulmans&mdash;an interior
covering several acres, not very lofty, yet imposing from its exquisite
proportions. A wilderness, a cool, dark labyrinth of pillars from which
light horseshoe arches rise, broken midway for the curve of another
arch surmounting each of these, spreads itself out under the roof on
every hand&mdash;grove of stone in a cave of stone stretching so far that
the eye cannot follow its intricate regularity, its rare harmony of confusion.
The rash Christian renovators who, overruling the protest of the
city, undertook to remodel so exceptional a monument, covered the
arches with whitewash; but many of them have been restored to the
natural hues of their red and white marble. Imagine below them the
pillars, smooth-shafted and with fretted capitals. Of old there were
<i>twelve hundred</i> of them supporting the gilded beams and incorruptible
larch of the roof, and a thousand still stand. Each is shaped from a
single block, and many quarries contributed them. Jasper and porphyry,
black, white, and red, emerald and rose marble, are all represented
among them; though with their diversity they have this in common,
that from the pavement up to about the average human height they
have been worn dark, and even smoother than the workmen left them,
by the constant touching and rubbing and leaning of generations who
have loitered and worshipped in the solemn twilight that broods around
them. A large number were appropriated from the old Roman temple
which stood on the spot; others were plundered from temples at ancient
Carthage; still others were brought entire from Constantinople.
They typify the different powers that have been concerned in the
making and unmaking of Spain, and one could almost imagine that in
every column is concealed some petrified warrior of those conflicting
races, waiting for the spell that shall bring him to life again.</p>

<p>On the surface of one of these marble cylinders is scratched a rude<br />
and feeble image of Christ on the cross, hardly noticeable until pobr />
out. It is said to have been traced there by the finger-nail of a Christian
captive who was chained to the pillar when it formed part of a<a name="page_083" id="page_083"></a><a name="page_084" id="page_084"></a><a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a>
dungeon somewhere
else. He had ten
years for the work,
and enjoyed the advantage
of a tool
that would renew itself
without expense
whenever it began
to wear out. I must
say that we were
touched by this dim
record of the dead-and-gone
prisoner's
silent suffering and
faith. The shock of
doubt struck us only
when, in another
part of the mosque,
we came upon another
pillar against
the wall, bearing an exact reproduction of the finger-nail sculpture, and
furthermore provided with a holy-water basin and a lamp burning under
the effigy of the captive, who appears to have been canonized.
"How is this?" I asked the guide. "Here is the same thing over
again!" He scrutinized me carefully,
taking an exact measure of
my credulousness, before he replied,
"Ah, but the other is the
real one!" It all seems to depend
on which pillar gets the
start.

<p>But there is no deception
whatever connected with the
inner Mihrab, where there is a
marvellous alcove marking the
direction of Mecca, on the east.
Its ceiling, in the shape of a quarter-globe,
is cut from a single
great piece of marble, which is
<a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a>grooved like a shell. And when
the light from candles is thrown into this Arab chapel it glances upon
elaborate enamelling on the surface, the vitreous glaze of minute and
almost miraculous mosaic making it flash and sparkle with rays of the
ruby, the emerald, the topaz, and diamond. There in the dusk the
glittering splendor scintillates as brilliantly as it did eight hundred
years ago, and shoots its beams upon the unwary eye as if it were a
cimeter of the defeated race suddenly unsheathed for vengeance. In
this place was kept the wondrous Koran stand of Al-Hakem II., which
cost a sum equal now to about five million dollars. It disappeared a
while ago&mdash;mislaid, it should seem, by some sacristan of orderly habits
who was clearing up the rubbish, for no one appears to know where it
went to. The sacred book within it was incased in gold tissue embroidered
with pearls and rubies, and around the spot where it was enshrined
the solid white marble floor is unevenly worn into a circular
hollow, where the servants of the Prophet used to crawl seven times in
succession on their hands and knees. This homage was paid by the
brother of the Emperor of Morocco only a few years since, when he
visited Spain, and indulged the luxurious woe of weeping over the fair
empire his people had lost. The bewildering arabesques, the lines of
which pursue and lose each other so mysteriously about the shrine,
managing to form pious inscriptions in their intricate convolutions&mdash;by
an exception to all other Hispano-Arabic decoration, which employs
only stucco&mdash;are wrought in marble, frigid and stern as death, but embossed
into a living grace as of vine tendrils.
</p>

<p>Whetstone had been remarkably silent after entering the Mezquita.
I fancied that he did not wholly approve of it. But after we had looked
long at this epitome of the beautiful which I have just tried to
sketch, he observed, impartially, in turning away, "I tell you, those
fellows knew how to chisel some!" He had merely been trying to reduce
the facts to their lowest terms.</p>

<p>Priests and boys were marching with crucifixes from the choir as
we came away: the incense rolled up against the lofty smoke-dimmed
altar; and the mild-faced celibate who played the organ sent harmonies
of unusually rich music (performed at our guide's special request) reverberating
among the thousand-columned maze of low arches. But
my fancy went back to the time when gold and silver lamps had shed
from their perfumed oils the only illumination there, and when the jewelled
walls, smouldering in the faint light, had looked down upon the
prostrate forms of robed and turbaned zealots. Then we passed out
through the Court of Oranges into the street, with those forty towers<a name="page_087" id="page_087"></a>
of the cathedral wall again seen standing guard around it, and found
ourselves once more in modern Cordova.</p>

<p>The breath of the South, the meridional aroma, welcomed us. The
scent of the air in the neighboring Alcazar garden would of itself have
been enough to tell us, in the dark, that we had entered Andalusia.
That was beyond question a most delectable spot. A sort of fortress-prison
bordered it, and immediately on the other side of the prison-wall
blossomed the garden, where lemons and oranges and bergamot
clambered rankly against the bricks, perfuming the whole atmosphere,
and overblown roses dropped from their vines on to the paths. There
were hedges of rosemary, and trees of pimento, and angular ribs of
prickly cactus, carefully trained. From a balustraded terrace higher up
descended a stone flight of steps, the massive stone guard of which on
each side was scooped out so as to make a mossy bed for two streams
of water perpetually flowing down and losing themselves in the secret
courses that ministered to little scattered fountains, or laved the roots
of the verdant tangle. Now and again a lizard darted from point to
point, like an evil thought surprised in the heart of so much sweetness
and freshness. Everywhere there was a cool gush and ripple of water,
and some wide-spreading fig-trees made a pleasant bower in a bastion<a name="page_088" id="page_088"></a>
of the low garden-wall overlooking the famous river. From this post
of vantage one can see the thick brown current slowly oozing by, and
the ancient bridge which spans it, fortified at both ends, connecting the
Cordova of to-day with the opposite bank, where the ancient city extended
for two or three miles. With its great arched gate, Roman
made and finely sculptured, this mellow light brown structure forms
an effective link in the landscape, and below its piers stand several
Moorish mills, disused, but as yet unbroken by age or floods.</p>

<p>We drove across the venerable viaduct afterward, and found that
by an extraordinary dispensation some very fresh and shining silver
coins of ancient Rome had lately been dug up from one of the shoals
in the river (a peculiar place, by-the-way, to bury them in), and that our
guide had some in his pocket. We forbore to deprive him of such
treasures, however, even at the very trifling price which he put upon
them, and contented ourselves with being swindled by him in a subsequent
purchase of some other articles.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>F<small>ROM</small> Cordova may be made, by those who are especially favored,
one of the most interesting expeditions possible to the Hermitage, or,
as the Church authorities name it, the <i>Desierta</i> (desert) of solitary
monks, genuine anchorites, a few miles distant in the Sierra Morena.
There are obstacles more formidable than the purely physical ones in
the way of this excursion, the bishop of the diocese being averse to
granting permission for the visit to any one who is not a good Catholic.
Two Englishmen who came before us, relying on the potent
gold piece, had made the toilsome ascent only to find that their sterling
sovereigns were of no avail. I think the presence of the Novice
helped our party; but it would be unwise to reveal the stratagem by
which we all gained admittance. Let it be enough to say that we
went to the bishop's palace after the usual hours of business, and by
humble apologies obtained an audience with the secretary. While we
were waiting we sat down under a frivolously gorgeous rococo ceiling,
on a great double staircase of marble leading up from the <i>patio</i>, which
was well planted with shrubs, and had walks paved with smooth round
stones of various hue, set edgewise in extensive patterns. The vaulted
ceiling resounded powerfully with every remark we made, which had
the result of subduing our conversation to whispers, for an attendant
soon came to warn us that the bishop was asleep, and that we must not<a name="page_089" id="page_089"></a><a name="page_090" id="page_090"></a><a name="page_091" id="page_091"></a>
speak loud on account of the echo. Profiting by the great man's siesta,
we extracted the desired permission from his severe-faced but courteous
secretary, who marked the document "Especial."</p>

</p>

<p>Our brief cavalcade of donkeys started the next morning at five, after
we had taken a preternaturally early cup of chocolate. The donkeys
appeared to know just where we were going, and would not obey the
rein: the driver, walking behind, governed them by a system of negatives,
informing them with a casual exclamation when they showed
signs of turning where he didn't want them to. "Advance there,
Baker!" he would cry. "Don't you know better than that? What a
wretched little beast! Do as I tell you." The animal in question was
named Bread-dealer, or Baker, and the one that I rode rejoiced in the
eccentric though eminently literary appellation of "College."</p>

<p>"To the right, College!" our muleteer would shout, exercising a
despotic power over my four-footed institution of learning. "Get up,
little mule. <i>Arré burr-r-rico!</i>" Firing off a volley of <i>r</i>'s with a tremendous
rising and falling intonation, which invariably moved the brute to
take one or two rapid steps before dropping back into his customary
slow walk. As the heat increased, and the way grew steeper, he sighed
out his "arré"&mdash;gee up&mdash;in a long, melancholy drawl, which seemed
to express profound despair concerning the mulish race generally.
Muleteers in Spain are termed generically, from this surviving Arabic
word, <i>arrieros</i>, or, as we may translate it, "gee-uppers."</p>

<p>In this manner we made our way along the dusty road among olive
orchards, and a sort of oak called <i>japarros</i>, until we began to mount by
a rough, stony path which sometimes divided itself like the branches
of a torrent, though we more than once succeeded in prodding the
donkeys into a lively canter. The white façades of villas&mdash;<i>quintas</i> or
<i>carmens</i> they are denominated hereabout&mdash;twinkled out from nooks of
the hills; but at that early hour everything was very still. We could
almost <i>see</i> the silence around us. Higher up, unknown birds began to
sing in the sparse boscage that clothed the mountain flank or clustered
in its narrow dells. Midway of the ascent, furthermore, Baker, on whom
Velveteen was seated in solemn stride, with a blanket in place of saddle,
paused ominously, and then began a nasal performance which
shook our very souls. Why a donkey should bray in such a place it
is hard to determine, but <i>how</i> he did it will forever remain impressed
on our tympana. There was something peculiarly terrible and unnerving
in the sound; and just as it ceased, our guide, Manuel, observed
that this had once been a great place for robbers. "A few years ago,"<a name="page_092" id="page_092"></a>
said he, "no one would have dared to come up along this road as we
are doing." He added that the marauders used to conceal themselves
in the numerous caves in the region, and pointed out one fissure in the
rocks which his liberal imagination converted into the entrance of a
subterranean retreat running for several miles into the heart of the
mountains. At the same instant, looking down across a gorge below
our track, I saw a man with a gun moving through a patch of steep
olives, as if to head us off at a point farther along; and on a jutting
rock-rib above us a memorial cross rose warningly. Crosses were formerly
put up in the most impossible places among these hills, to mark
the spot where anybody fell a victim to bandits or assassins; a fact of
which the elder Dumas makes telling use in one of his short stories.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Brigands were themselves punctilious in setting up these reminders,
which were held to exert an expiatory influence. If any one would
understand how hopelessly the Spanish mind at one time perverted the
relations of crime and religion, he may read Calderon's "Devotion of the
Cross," wherein the hero, Eusebio, a terrible renegade who murders right
and left, born at the foot of one of these way-side crosses, is saved by
his reverence for the holy symbol. He is enabled, by virtue of this
pious sentiment, to rise up after he is dead, walk about, and confess
his sins to a friar; after which he is caught up into heaven!</p>

<p>The whole conjunction was somewhat alarming, but Manuel explained
away our man with a gun by saying that he was merely one
of the armed watchmen usually attached to country estates to protect
crops and stock from depreciation. As for the bandits, they had now
been quite dispersed, he declared, by the Civil Guard. That name, it
is true, called up new fears for Velveteen and myself as we thought of
the two relentless men who were on our trail: but we knew that for the
moment, at least, we were beyond their reach.</p>

<p>At last we gained the very summit, and drew up under a porch at
the walled gate of the Desert, while a shower began to fall in large
scattered drops, like the lingering contents of some gigantic watering-pot,
but soon spent itself. Our second pull at the mournful-sounding
bell was answered by a sad young monk, who opened a square loop-hole
in the wall, and asked our errand in a voice enfeebled by voluntary
privations. After inspecting our pass, he told us, with a wan but
friendly smile, that we must wait a little. It was Friday, and we had
to wait rather long, for the hermits were just at that time undergoing<a name="page_093" id="page_093"></a>
the weekly flagellation to which they subject themselves. But finally
we were let in&mdash;donkeys, guide, <i>arriero</i>, and the colored maid "Fan"
sharing the hospitality. An avenue of tall, sombre, cypresses opened
before us, leading to the main building and offices. The Desert, in
fact, was green enough; well supplied with olives and pomegranates;
and hedges of the prickly-pear, with its thick, stiff leaves shaped like
a fire-shovel, and heavy as wax-work, cinctured the isolated huts in
which the brothers dwell each by himself. Precisely as we came to a
triangular plot in front of the entrance we were confronted by a skull
set up prominently in a sort of pyramidal monument, giving force by
its dusty grin to an inscription in Spanish, which read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p class="c">"AS THOU LOOKEST, SO ONCE LOOKED I:<br />
AS I LOOK NOW, SO WILT THOU APPEAR HEREAFTER.<br />
     PONDER UPON THIS, AND SIN NOT."</p>
</div>

<p class="nind">Shortly beyond stood a catacomb above-ground, in which a number
of defunct hermits had been sealed up. It also bore a legend, but in
Latin:</p>

<p class="c">"THE DAY OF DEATH IS BETTER THAN THAT OF BIRTH."</p>

<p class="nind">In the vestibule of the house these drastic reminders of mortality were
supplemented by two allegorical pictures&mdash;hanging among some portraits
of evanished worthies who had ended their penitential days there&mdash;two
crude paintings which exhibited "The Soul Tortured by Doubt,"
and "The Soul Blessed by Faith." It was not altogether in keeping
with the unworldly and ascetic atmosphere of this spiritual refuge, that
a tablet in the wall should record, with fulsome abasement of phrase,
how her most Gracious Majesty Isabella II. had, some few years ago,
deigned to visit the Desert, and how this stone had been placed there
as a humble monument of her condescension. Certainly, considering
the ex-Queen's character (if it may claim consideration), it is hard to
see what honor the anchorites should find in her visiting their abode.</p>

<p>A gray-haired brother, robed in the coarse and weighty brown serge
which he is obliged to wear in winter and summer alike, received us
kindly and showed us the expensively adorned plateresque chapel. He
knelt and bowed nearly to the threshold before unlocking the door,
crossed himself, and knelt again on the pavement within; then, advancing
farther, he dropped down once more on both knees, and bent over
as if he had some intention of using his good-natured, simple old head
as a mop to polish the black and white marble squares, but ended by<a name="page_094" id="page_094"></a>
another cross, and moving his lips in noiseless prayer. The
national manner of making the cross is peculiar: after the usual touching
of forehead and breast, the Spanish Catholic concludes by suddenly
attempting to swallow his thumb, and then as hastily pulling it out of
his mouth again, to save it up for some other time. This movement, I
suppose, emblemizes the eating of the consecrated wafer, but it makes
a grotesque impression that is anything but solemn. At times you will
also see him execute a unique triple cross, with strange passes and dabs
in the air which might easily be mistaken for preliminary strategy directed
against some erring
mosquito engaged in guerilla
warfare on his eyebrow.
We were obliged,
in conformity, to do as
our Catholic companions
did&mdash;receiving the holy-water
and making a simple
cross&mdash;an act which,
without being of their
faith, one may perform
with unsectarian reverence.
Brother Esteban
was on the watch to see
that proper devotion was
shown in this peculiarly
sacred chapel, and in the
midst of his adoration he
turned quickly upon Manuel,
asking, "Why don't
you go down on <i>both</i> your knees in the accustomed manner?"</p>

<p>Manuel, being a master of ready deception, answered, without an instant's
delay, "Ah, that is my misfortune! I lately had an accident to
that leg" (indicating the one which had not sunk far enough), "and
that is why it is not easy to get down on both knees." However, he
spread his handkerchief wider, and painfully brought the offending
member into place.</p>

<p>Esteban frankly apologized, and then the praying went on again.</p>

<p>When we got out into the corridor, and our monkish friend was
well in advance, black Fan's repressed heresy broke into a startling reaction.
She dipped her hand again and again into the basin of holy-water<a name="page_095" id="page_095"></a>,
wastefully dropping some of it on the floor, and began outlining
unlimited crosses from her sable forehead downward&mdash;covering her
breast with an imaginary armor of them&mdash;enough to keep her supplied
for a month, and proof against every possible misfortune. Her broad
grin of delight, exposing her vermilion lips and white teeth like a slice
of unripe watermelon, added to the horror of the situation, and I protested
against such uncouth profanity.</p>

<p>"Might's well keep goin' now I begun," she chuckled in reply. "I's
'fraid I'll forgit how!" She was making another plunge for the font,
when our pale, gentle-featured Novice stopped her in mid-career.</p>

<p>Fortunately good Esteban had not observed this small orgy going
on. He was as pleasant as ever when we went with him into a little
room to buy rosaries and deposit some silver pieces for charity; and
there he made farther and profuse apologies to Manuel. "Of course
you see it was impossible I should know there was anything the matter
with your leg," he said, quite plaintively. And Manuel accepted his
contrition with double pleasure because he knew it to be wholly undeserved.</p>

<p>The hermits, as I have said, have their separate cottages scattered
about the grounds, each with a small patch of land to be cultivated.
There they raise fruit, which their rules forbid them to eat, and so it is
carried down as a present to some wealthy Cordovan families who support
the hermitage by their largesses. Every day poor folk toil up
from the plain, some five miles, to this airy perch, and are fed by the
monks; but they themselves eat little, abstaining from meat, wine,
coffee, tea&mdash;everything, indeed, except some few ounces of daily bread,
a pint of <i>garbanzos</i> (the tasteless, round yellow bean which is the universal
food of the poor in Spain), and a soup made of bread, water, oil,
and garlic. They live on nothing and prayer. They rise at three in
the morning, and thrice a week they fast from that hour until noon.
Their step is slow, and their voices have a strange, inert, sickly sound;
but they appeared cheerful enough, and joked with each other. I
asked Esteban the name of a tiny yellow flower growing by the path,
and he couldn't tell me; but he plucked it tenderly, and began discoursing
to Manuel on its beauty. "<i>Tan chiquita</i>," he said, in his poor
soft voice. "So <i>little, little</i>, and yet so precious and so finely made!"
Another brother was deeply absorbed in snipping off bits of coiled
brass wire with a pair of pincers. "These are for the 'Our Fathers,'"
he explained, meaning the large beads in the rosary, separated from the
smaller "Ave Maria" ones by links of wire. The cottages or huts, surrounded<a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a>
by an outer wall, contain a cell, sometimes cut out of a bowlder
lying on the spot, where there is a rude cot, a shelf for holy books and
the crucifix, and a grated window, across which waves, perhaps, the
broad-leaved bough of a fig-tree. An anteroom, provided with a few
utensils and the disciplinary scourge hanging mildly against the wall,
completes the strange interior. The lives of the hermits of the Sierra
are reduced to the ghastly simplicity of a skeleton; a part of their time
is spent in contemplating skulls, and they have a habit of digging their
own graves, in order to keep more plainly before their minds the end
of all earthly careers. Mistaken as all this seems to many of us, there
was a peacefulness about the Hermitage for which many a storm-tossed
soul sighs in vain; and I am glad that some few creatures can find here
the repose they desire while waiting for death. Some of the hermits
are men of rank, who have retired hither disheartened with the world;
others are low-born&mdash;men afflicted by some form of misfortune or
misdemeanor of their own, who wish to hide from life; but all assemble
in a pure democracy of sorrow and penitential piety, apparently
contented.</p>

<p>We breakfasted at ten in a room hospitably put at our disposal, the
windows of which admitted a delicious breeze and opened upon a magnificent
view of the plain far below, where the distant city rested like
a white mist&mdash;an impalpable thing. Brother José brought some olives,
to add to the refection which our sumpter-mule had carried to this
height. They had a ripe, acid, oily flavor, which made one think of
homely things and of patient housewives in remote American hills, who
lead lives as monotonous, as self-denying and unnoticed as those which
pass on this ridge of the Sierra in Andalusia. Our Novice thought
the olives had "a holy flavor;" and I could understand her feeling.
Find me a site more fitted for meditation on the volatility of mundane
things than this eyry on the mountain-head overlooking the historic
valley! There lies Cordova, a mere spot in the reach of soft citron
and straw-tinted fields; and the Guadalquivir, winding like a neglected
skein of tawny silk thrown down on the mapped landscape. The plain
is calm as oblivion. It is oblivion's self; for there the earth has absorbed
Cordova the Old, so that not a vestige remains where compressed
masses of human dwellings once stood. They are crumbled to
an indistinguishable powder. That soft autumnal soil has swallowed up
the bones of unnumbered generations, and no trace of them is left. We
imagined the glittering legions of Cæsar as they moved slowly through
the country, flashing the sun from their compact steel, at that time<a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a><a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a><a name="page_099" id="page_099"></a>
when they put to the sword twenty-five thousand inhabitants of the
city, which had sided with Pompey. We saw the Moors once more
envelop it with arms and banners and the fluttering of snowy garments.
But all these vanished again like a moving cloud, or a smoke from
burning stubble; and the sun still pours its uninterrupted flood of
splendor over the land, bringing life and bringing death, with impartial
ray.</p>

<p>The Spanish word for "crowded" or "populated" is still used to
signify "dense" in any ordinary connection, as the phrase <i>barba poblada</i>,
for a thick beard, testifies. The implication is that, when there is
any population at all, it must be crowded; a direct transmission, apparently,
from periods when inhabitants clustered in immense numbers
around the centres of civil power for safety. And the word holds
good to-day; for one finds, in the present shrunken human force of the
Peninsula, closely packed assemblages of people in the towns and cities,
with wide domains of comparatively untenanted country around.</p>

<p>When night closed above us again in the city; when mellow lamps
glowed, and a tropical fragrance flowed in from the gardens; when in
the long dusky pauses of warm nocturnal silence the watchman's weary
and pathetic cry resounded, or hollow-toned church-bells rung the hour,
the romance of Cordova seemed to concentrate itself, and fell upon
me, as I listened, in chords that took this form:</p>

<p>There was a good deal of discussion among our group of pilgrims
as to the propriety of a foundation like the Hermitage of the Sierra continuing
to exist in an age like the present one. Whetstone, who had<a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a>
declined to visit it, was
of opinion that men
who led such idle lives
should be suppressed
by law, and even went
so far as to talk about
hanging them. So singular
a theory, emanating
from a citizen of a
free republic, met with
some opposition; but
this was not pushed
too far, because we understood
that Whetstone
kept a hotel at
home, and dreaded lest
some day we should
be at his mercy. As for the rest of us, it was not easy to pronounce
that we were of much more value than the hermits; and assuredly
those earnest ascetics compared favorably with our mule-driver, who
was remarkable only for an expression of incipient humor that was never
able to attain the height of actual expression. I was sure that, as he
sighed out his final "Arré" in this world, he would pass into the next
with that vacant smile on his face, and the joke which he might have
perpetrated under fortunate circumstances still unuttered. Nor did
the average life of Cordova strike us as signally indispensable to the
world's progress. It was doubtless a very pleasant, lazy life so far as
it went, and we did not decide to hang the inhabitants!
They have a charming fashion there of
building houses with pleasant interior courts, in
which the <i>sclinda</i>, a vine with pale lavender clusters
of blossoms suggesting the wistaria, droops
amid matted foliage, and lends its grace alike to
crumbling architecture or modern masonry. In
these courts, separated from the street by gates
of iron grating beautifully designed, you will see
pleasant little domestic groups, and possibly a
whole dinner-party going on in the fresh air. It
was likewise agreeable to repair to a certain restaurant&mdash;restored
in the Moorish manner&mdash;and<a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a>
there, while clapping hands echoed through the light arcades, drink
iced beer and lemon&mdash;a refreshing beverage, which might reasonably
take the place of fiery punches (in America) for hot weather. "Neither
will I deny," said Velveteen, "that it is a wonderful sensation to stray
into the Plaza de Geron Paez and come up suddenly against that glorious
old Roman gate&mdash;growing up as naturally as the trees in front
of it, but so much more wonderful than they&mdash;with its fine crumbling
yellow traceries. How nicely it would tell in a sketch, eh, with some
of the royal grooms&mdash;the <i>remontistas</i>&mdash;walking through the foreground
in their quaint costumes!"

<p>The men to whom he referred wear, in the best sense, a thoroughly
theatrical garb of scarlet and black, finished off by boots of Cordovan
leather in the style of sixteenth-century Spain, turned down at the top,
laced, tasselled, and slashed open by a curve that runs from the side
down to the back of the heel. This shows the white stocking under
short trousers, giving to the masculine calf and ankle a grace for which
they are usually denied all credit.</p>

<p>For the rest, dwellers in modern Cordova attend mass and vespers,
stroll around to the confectioners' of an afternoon to eat sweetmeats,
especially sugared <i>higochumbos</i> (the unripe prickly-pear boiled in syrup),
or the famed and fragrant preserve of budding orange-blossoms known
as <i>dulces de alzahar</i>; and the remainder of the time they while away
pleasantly in loitering on the Street of the Great Captain, or in peering
from their windows at whatever passes beneath. Throughout the kingdom,
it should be said, a most extraordinary persistence will be observed
in dawdling, strolling, and general contemplation. The Spaniard
appears to be born with his legs in a walking position, and with
loaded eyes that compel him to look out of the window whether he
wants to or not.</p>

<p>One of the more remarkable observations, finally, that I collected
in Cordova came from Manuel. It was his reflection as he gazed down
from the Desierta into the plain: "Ah, that was where John Dove
(Juan Palom) did such splendid things!" he sighed. "You don't know
about John Dove? Well, he was one of the <i>very greatest</i> men Spain
ever had; he was a robber&mdash;and oh, what a beautiful robber!"<a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a></p>

keep the proper and more
euphonious form, Sevilla?&mdash;the
home of that Don Juan
on whom Byron and Mozart
have shed a lustre more enviable
than his reputation, has
been made familiar to every
one by melodious Figaro as
well; and more lately Mérimée's
Carmen, veiled in the
music of Bizet, has brought it
into the foreign consciousness
again.</p>

<p>To me it is memorable as
the place where I saw the jars
in which the Forty Thieves
were smothered. Worried by
a painfully profuse odor that
filled the whole street, one day
I sought the cause, and found
it in an olive-oil merchant's
<i>tienda</i>, where there were some
terra-cotta jars of the exact
form given in the story-books,
and afflicted with elephantiasis to such a degree that one or two men
could easily have hidden in each. I am sure they were the same into
which Morgiana poured the boiling oil, though why it should have been
heated is inexplicable: the smell alone ought to have been fatal.</p>

<p>A prouder distinction is that Sevilla is the capital of Andalusia, that<a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a>
gayest and most diversified province of Spain; the native ground of
the bull-fight and breeder of the best bulls; a region abounding in racy
customs and characteristics. The sea-going Ph&oelig;nicians, who bear down
on us from so many points of the historical compass, found in Andalusia
an important trading field. Its mountains are still stored with silver,
copper, gold, lead, which have yielded steady tribute for thousands
of years. In its breadths of sun-bathed plain and orange-mantled slope
the ancients placed their Elysian Fields. Goth and Roman, Moor and
Spaniard, struggled for the mastery of so rich a possession; and meanwhile
Sevilla, the favorite of Cæsar&mdash;his "little Rome"&mdash;lay at the core
of the fruitful land, herself careless in the main as to everything except
an easy life, with plenty of singing and love-making. From climate
and history, nevertheless, from art and the mingling of antipodal races,
Sevilla received those influences which have shaped her into the bizarre
and eminently Spanish creation that she is&mdash;a visible memory of the
past, and a sparkling embodiment of the present. Society, amusement,
and religious awe are the controlling aims of the people, blended with
revolutionary politics, and great liveliness in their increasing commerce.
The songs of Andalusia pervade the whole kingdom; its dances&mdash;<i>cidarillos</i>,
<i>manchegas</i>, <i>boleros</i>, the <i>cachuca</i>, and the wildly graceful <i>Sevillanas</i>&mdash;enjoy
an equal renown.</p>

<p>To accept Sevilla without disappointment, however, a robust appreciation
is needed. Its squalors and splendors are impartially distributed.
Luxurious mansions are dropped down indiscriminately among
mean abodes and the homes of dirt. Poverty and showiness, supreme
beauty and grotesque ugliness, jostle each other at close quarters. It
is a sort of <i>olla podrida</i> among cities; but the total result is exceedingly
curious, and piques the observation.</p>

<p>The first of it that met our eyes was the Giralda tower of the cathedral,
rising in unique majesty above the unseen town, and as if inspired
with a fresher grace by its own fame. If the bronze female figure of
Faith on the summit could have spoken, it might have said: "In all
the range of view from this pinnacle there is nothing so fair as Sevilla."
The very next object of notice was a woman in the street, who began
begging from below the instant we set foot on the balcony for a general
survey. She gave us our money's worth of misery, but the supply
afterward proved too great for our demand. The mendicants of Sevilla
are much more daring and pertinacious than their craft elsewhere.
They call your attention with a sharp "tst, tst," as if you were hired to
go through life casually, stopping the instant they summon you. There<a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a><a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a><a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a>
was in particular one energetic man
who never failed to pounce upon us
from his lair, and place some few inches
in front of us the red and twisted
stump from which his hand had been
severed. He had seemingly persuaded
himself that our journey of several
thousand miles was undertaken principally
to inspect this anatomical
specimen. The amount of execution
he did with that mutilated
member was enough to shame
any able-bodied, self-supporting
person. With a single wave of
it he could put us to
flight.</p>

<p class="nind">The effect
would not have been more
instantaneous if he had suddenly
unmasked a mitrailleuse
a yard from our noses.
To assume unconsciousness
was futile, for, whichever way
we turned, he was always (it
would hardly be correct to
say "on hand," but) on time
with his fingerless deformity<a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a>&mdash;he
always placed it, with the instinct of a finished artist, in the best
light and most effective pose&mdash;getting it adroitly between us and anything
we pretended to look at.
</p>

<p>I imagined the noble cathedral might afford a refuge from such attacks,
but every door was guarded by a squad of the decrepit army, so
that entrance there became a horror. These sanctuary beggars serve a
double purpose, however. The black-garbed Sevillan ladies, who are
perpetually stealing in and out noiselessly under cover of their archly
draped lace veils&mdash;losing themselves in the dark, incense-laden interior,
or emerging from confession into the daylight glare again&mdash;are careful
to drop some slight conscience-money into the palms that wait. Occasionally,
by pre-arrangement, one of these beggars will convey into the
hand that passes him a silver piece a tightly-folded note from some
clandestine lover. It is a convenient underground mail, and I am
afraid the venerable church innocently shelters a good many little
transactions of this kind.</p>

<p>Nothing can surpass in grandeur, in solemn and restful beauty, the
hollow mountain of embellished stone which constitutes this cathedral.
It does not present the usual cross shape, but is based upon the oblong
form of an old mosque, originally formed somewhat like that at Cordova,
but now wholly gone, excepting for the unequalled Giralda, and
a few other minor muezzin towers. The Court of Oranges is another
relic of the mosque-builders, where clumps of polished leafage contrast
their own vivid strength with the energetic lines of flying-buttresses in
the background&mdash;a florid yet melancholy height of trellised stone. The
enclosing walls of the Orange Court, made of firmly cohering mud, or
<i>tapia</i>, are tipped with flame-pointed battlements. At their eastern end
rises the tall, square Giralda, with a serenity in its simple lines expressing,
like Greek temples, the satisfied senses controlled by an elevated
mind. The lower portion bears other impress of its Moorish origin in
variously patterned courses of sunken brick; but the whole tower terminates
in a filigree Christian spire of the sixteenth century, with a row
of queer rusty iron ornaments, imitating vases filled with flowers, placed
on the ledge above the belfry at the spire's base. Then, as you continue
the circuit on the east, you arrive opposite the apse curve marking
the chancel of the Chapel Royal; and here the wall is moulded to
the taste of Charles V.'s time, which affected Roman simplicity and
weight, adding to it a trace of feudal pomp in high-relief coats of arms.
On the third and south side a crumbling frieze of deer's heads and
flower garlands skirts the cornice above a long plain front, the straightness<a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a><a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a><a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a>
of which our friend Whetstone, clambering up on a low coping
so as to squint along the side, and see if the lines were perfectly true,
admired more than anything else. Afterward one reaches a corner
where the work remains unfinished, and the blackened trunks of incomplete
pinnacles in graded ranks suggest the charred fragments of a faith
once all afire, now darkened and cold. There is no all-dominating
dome; but there are two or three bulbous upheavals in the roof, some
spindling turrets on the north, and a square elevation in the middle revealing
the form of the transept. The whole top is ribbed with stone,
serrated with ornate crockets, crowded with bosses and small spires, or
edged with a double balustrade mimicking in its flame-points a thousand
altar lights. Petrified rosettes and spiral wreathings project from
the sides in unchangeable efflorescence, and great arches, furrowed
around by concentric ripples of carving, and sometimes overpeered by
quaint terra-cotta heads, give entrance to the interior of the gigantic
marvel. And over all towers the Giralda to a height of three hundred
and fifty feet, surmounted by the Giraldillo vane&mdash;a woman's form,
which turns its twenty-five hundred-weight of bronze from point to
point at the slightest veering of the wind. But the consummate wonder
of this great fabric, under which prostrate ages seem to crouch
while lifting it to heaven, is the union of diverse styles and spirits in its
construction. The different schools conglomerated in such an exterior
give the cathedral a great and mysterious power of variety; yet, decided
though their contrasts are, the effect is not harsh. It bears witness
to the truth that the spirit of man when attuned to the mood of
sincere worship, however unlike its expression may be at different
epochs and through different races, will always make a certain grand
inclusive harmony with itself.</p>

<p>The coolness of the lofty and umbrageous aisles within is not penetrated
by the fiercest summer heats; but their religious twilight,
though inciting to a devout and prayerful sentiment, wraps in obscurity
the crowded works of art, the emblazoned <i>retablos</i>, the paintings of
Murillo, Campaña, and Morales, and the costly ornaments bestowed
upon the high altar, as well as those of some thirty side-chapels. In
the central nave, before a shrine at the choir-back, lies the tomb of Ferdinand,
son of Christopher Columbus. The colossal form of another
Christopher, the saint, lifts itself up the wall to a height of thirty-two
feet, near the Gate of the Exchange. Whoever looks upon St. Christopher,
to him no harm shall come during that day; hence this worthy
is a common object in Spanish cathedrals, and always painted so large<a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a>
that no one who diligently attends mass can possibly miss seeing him. A
curious relic on the Chapel Royal altar is the Battle Virgin, a small ivory
image which King Ferdinand the Sainted always carried in war firmly
fixed on his saddle-bow. There, too, the King himself, embalmed, is preserved
in a chiselled silver case, to be uncovered and shown three times
a year with great pomp of military music. A life-size Virgin with movable
joints and spun-gold hair watches over him, but did not prevent his
crown from being stolen a few years ago. Not far away Murillo's San
Antonio hangs, the chief figure in which was also stolen, being cut out
in 1874, as many who read this will remember, and carried to New York,
where it was recovered. Innumerable other works and wonders there
are, and the sacristies contain great value of goldsmiths' products; but,
unless it be made a subject of long artistic study, the fundamental
charm of the cathedral consists in its general aspects, its mysterious
perspectives, its proportions so simple and grandiose; the isolated
pictures formed at almost any point by jewelled and candle-lit chapels
sparkling dimly through a permanent dusk, rainbowed here and there
by the light from old stained windows.</p>

<p>From the Giralda, which is mounted by inclined planes in place of
stairs, one looks down upon the glorious building as if it were something
belonging to a lower and different world. All around, beyond,
the mazy city flattens itself out in a confusion of white walls and tiled
roofs, that look like the armored backs of scaly monsters huddled sluggishly
in the powerful sunshine, with impossible streets among them
reduced to mere thin lines of shadow. The tawny river touches it;
palaces and gardens and abandoned monasteries fringe it. Quite near
you see the Tower of Gold&mdash;a surviving outwork of the Moorish defences&mdash;which
was formerly coated with orange-colored tiles on the
outside, while the inside furnished a repository for treasure brought
from the New World. A crenellated Moorish fortification rises up
dreamily at one point, but finding itself out of date, abruptly subsides
again. Farther out are the seven suburbs, including the gypsy and
sailor quarter, the Triana; and then the plains stretch into an immense
area of olive, gold, and white, reaching to mountains on the north and
east. A multitude of doves inhabit the spire, and there is almost always
a hawk sailing above it, higher than anything else under the
cloudless sky. At the base lives the bell-ringer, through whose stone-paved
dining-room and nursery, filled with his family, we had to pass
in order to ascend. Once, as we stood toward sunset in the high gallery
where the bells are hung in rectangular or arched apertures, we<a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a>
heard the <i>repique</i> sounding the Angelus. It was a furious explosion of
metallic resonance.</p>

<p>Twenty bells on swinging beams, that throw the echoing mouths
outward through the openings, and two fixed in place within, of which
Santa Maria&mdash;profanely called The Fat One&mdash;is the largest: such is
the battery at command. They are not all used at once, however, for
the Angelus. The ringer and his two sons were satisfied with touching
up Santa Catalina (of a tone peculiarly deep and acceptable), St. John
the Baptist, San José, and one or two others. The whole brazen family
have been duly baptized, among them being San Laureano and San
Isidoro, named after the special patrons of Sevilla. One after another
their tongues rolled forth a deafening roar, in a systematic disorder of
thunderous tones, while the chief ringer went about unconcernedly with
a smouldering cigarette in his lips. One of his sons, after uncoiling the
twisted rope around the beam of San Laureano, thus getting it into
violent motion, watched his chance, sprung on to the beam, agile as a
cat, and stood there while it rocked, the bell under him swinging out
at each turn, over the open square below. It was three hundred feet,
down to the pavement, and the least slip would have sent him down
to it like a handful of dirt. His conception of what would please us,
nevertheless, led him thoroughly to unnerve us by repeating the performance
several times.</p>

<p>"Why don't the high-priest, or whatever he is, go on and finish up
this church?" asked Whetstone of the guide. "Seems to me it's about
time."</p>

<p>"The priest? He don't want to," was Vincent's answer, given
with a movement of the fingers meant to imply the receiving of money.
"It make too good excuse."</p>

<p>Our conductor, who I am sure was a sceptic, went on to declare that
within the last ten years ninety thousand dollars had been left by will
for carrying on the unfinished portion of the cathedral, but as yet no
movement to begin the work had been made. "Where all that money
go?" he asked, innocent curiosity overspreading his features, while his
eye gleamed with hidden intelligence.</p>

<p>"What do the people think of the priests?" one of us asked.</p>

<p>"The chimneys<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> will find out some time," he replied; adding, in the
proverbial strain common with Spaniards: "When the river comes
down from the mountains, it brings stones."<a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a></p>

<p>"By the river, you mean revolution? But you've had that before."</p>

<p>The conclusive answer to this was a maxim borrowed from the ring:
"The fifth bull is never a bad one" (meaning, "Success comes to those
who wait").</p>

<p>Our guide's English was put to a severe strain in the Alcazar, a
palace largely Oriental, with interiors that outshine the Alhambra in
resplendent color and gilding. There is, in particular, one round-domed
ceiling constructed with an intricacy of interdependent supports, cones,
truncations, dropping cusps, which is counterpoint made plastic; and
in its inverted cup-like cysts the burnished gold glows like clotted
honey. But, for all that, it does not equal the matchless Alhambra in
arrangement, variety, or poetic surroundings. The memory of King
Pedro the Cruel is closely connected with this Alcazar. From it he
used to make night sallies into the town, by means of what Vincent
termed a "soup-tureen passage," which brought him up through a trap-door
somewhere in the thick of his subjects. Pedro, who lived in the
fourteenth century, was a monarch of a severely playful disposition.
He used to have the heads of people that were obnoxious to him cut off,
and hung up over the lintel of his dressing-room door, where he could
look at them while he was putting in his shirt-studs, or whenever he
felt bored. In the extensive gardens, half Eastern and half mediæval,
behind the palace, among the box and myrtle planted in forms of heraldic
devices, among the palms and terraces and fountains, there run
long paths, secretly perforated in places for fine jets of water. These
are the traces of a still more ingenious amusement invented by Pedro.
From a place of concealment he would watch until the ladies of the
court, when promenading, had got directly over one of his underground&mdash;I
mean "soup-tureen"&mdash;fountains, then he would turn a faucet, and
drench them with a shower-bath from below.</p>

<p>There are other palaces in Sevilla, of which the Duke of Montpensier's
San Telmo is the chief, and a model of uninteresting magnificence,
aside from the valuable collection of old Spanish masters which it contains.
These pictures were sent to Boston for a loan exhibition during
the last revolution in Spain, in 1874; and although their aggregate
worth is easily surpassed by the pictures preserved at the public gallery
of Sevilla and at the Caridad Hospital, the Duke of Montpensier's
possessions embrace a masterly portrait of Velazquez, by himself (repeated
in the Museo at Valencia), and a charming "Madonna of the
Swaddling Clothes," by Murillo. San Telmo was formerly a nautical
college, having been founded by the son of Christopher Columbus.<a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a></p>

<p>But the long succession of apartments through which the visitor is
ushered suggests no association with the former maritime prowess of
Spain; it is haunted rather by the failures and disappointments of its
owner, who, missing the throne on which his foot had almost rested,
lived to see his daughter, Queen Mercedes, die, and another daughter
mysteriously follow Mercedes into the grave after being plighted to the
reigning King. The grounds attached to the palace are very large, and
filled with palms, orange-trees, and other less tropical growths; and
they may be inspected, under the guidance of a forester armed with an
innocuous gun, by anybody who, after getting permission, is willing to
pay a small fee and tire himself out by an aimless ramble.</p>

<p>Sevilla, where Murillo was born and spent so many years of artistic
activity in the height of his powers, is the next best place after Madrid
for a study of the sweetest among Spanish painters. His house still
stands in the Jews' Quarter, and a few of his best works are kept in
the picture-gallery; among them the one which he was wont to call
"my picture"&mdash;"St. Thomas of Villanueva Giving Alms." Like the
"Saint Elizabeth" at Madrid, it is a grand study of beggary&mdash;vagabondism
as you may see it to-day throughout Spain, but here elevated
by excellent design, charming sympathy with nature, and the resources
of a delightful colorist, into something possessing dignity and permanent
interest&mdash;qualities which the original phenomenon lacks. Murillo
is pure, sincere, simple, but never profound; though to this he perhaps
approaches more nearly in his "St. Francis Embracing the Crucified
Saviour" than in any other of his productions. Like others of his
pictures in Sevilla, however, it is painted in his latest style, called
"vaporoso," which, to my thinking, marks by its meretricious softness
of hazy atmosphere, and its too free coloring, a distinct decadence.
In the church connected with the Caridad are hung two colossal canvases,
one depicting the miracle of the loaves and fishes, the other,
Moses striking the rock. This last is better known by its popular title,
"The Thirst," which pays tribute to its masterly portrayal of that animal
desire. In the suffering revealed by the faces of the Israelites, as
well as the eager joy of the crowd (and even of their beasts of burden)
on receiving relief, there is a dramatic contention of pain and pleasure,
for the rendering of which the naturalistic genius of the artist was eminently
suited&mdash;and he has made the most of his opportunity. The
representation is terribly true; and its range of observation culminates
in the figure of the mother drinking first, though her babe begs for
water; for this is exactly what one would expect in Spanish mothers<a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a>
of her class, whose faces are lined with a sombre harshness, a want of
human kindness singularly repellent. Such a picture is hardly agreeable;
and it must be owned that, excepting in his gentle, honest "Conceptions,"<a name="page_119" id="page_119"></a>
and a few other pieces, Murillo shares the earthiness of his
national school, the effect of which, despite much magnificence in treatment,
is on the whole depressing.</p>

<p>The House of Pilate, owned by the Duke of Medina Celi, is quite
another sort of thing from San Telmo; a roomy, irregular edifice, dating
from the sixteenth century, but almost wholly Saracenic. The walls are
<i>repoussés</i> in fine arabesques, and sheathed at the base with old color-veined
tiles that throw back the light in flashes from their surface.
These also enamel the grand staircase, which makes a square turn beneath
a roof described as a <i>media naranja</i>&mdash;natural Spanish music for
our plain "half-orange"&mdash;the vault of which is fretted cedar cased in
stucco. At the top landing is posted a cock in effigy, representing the
one that crowed witness to Peter's denial. Again, a balcony is shown
which stands for that at which Pilate washed his hands before the people;
and in fine, the whole place is net-worked with fancies of this kind,
identifying it with the scene of Christ's trial. For it was the whim of
the lordly founder to make his house the starting-point for a Via Crucis,
marking the path of Jesus on his way to crucifixion, and these devices
were adopted to heighten the verisimilitude of the scene. In Passion-week
pilgrims come to pray at the several "stations" along the route
to the figurative Calvary at the end of the Via.</p>

<p>Into the Duke of Montpensier's garden stare the plebeian, commercial&mdash;let
us hope unenvious&mdash;windows of the government tobacco factory;
an enormous building, guarded like a fort to prevent the smuggling
out of tobacco. Indeed, every one of the three thousand women
employed is carefully watched for the same purpose as she passes forth
at the general evening dismissal. Mounting the broad stairs of stone,
I heard a peculiar medley of light sounds in the distance. If a lot of
steam-looms were endowed with the faculty of throwing out falsetto
and soprano notes instead of their usual inhuman click, the effect could
not be more uninterrupted than this subdued merry buzzing. It was the
chatter of the working-girls in the cigarette room. As we stepped over
the threshold these sounds continued with <i>crescendo</i> effect, ourselves being
taken for the theme. At least one hundred girls fixed their attention
on us, delivering a volley of salutations, jokes, and general remarks.</p>

<p>"What do you seek, little señor? You will get no <i>papelitos</i> here!"
exclaimed one, pretty enough to venture on sauciness.</p>

<p>"French, French! don't you see?" another said; and her companions,
in airy tones, begged us to disburse a few <i>cuartos</i>, which are cent-and-a-quarter
pieces.<a name="page_120" id="page_120"></a></p>

<p>There was one young person of a satirical turn who affected to
approve a very small beard which one of us had raised incidentally
in travelling. She stroked her own smooth cheek, and carolled out,
"What a pretty barbule!"</p>

<p>They certainly were not enslaved to conventionality, though they
may be to necessity. They seemed to enjoy themselves, too. Their
eyes flashed; they broke into laughter; they bent their heads to give
effect to the regulation flat curls on their temples, and all the time
their nimble fingers never stopped filling cigarettes, rolling the papers,
whisking them into bundles, and seizing fresh pinches of tobacco. In
all there were three or four hundred of them, and some of them had a
spendthrift, common sort of beauty, which, owing to their Southern vivacity
and fine physique, had the air of being more than it really was.
At first glance there appeared to be a couple of hundred other girls
hung up against the walls and pillars; but these turned out to be only
the skirts and boots of the workers, which are kept carefully away from
the smouch of the cigarette trays, so as to maintain the proverbially
neat appearance of their wearers on the street. Some of the women,
however, were scornful and morose, and others pale and sad. It was
easy to guess why, when we saw their babies lying in improvised box-cradles
or staggering about naked, as if intoxicated with extreme youth
and premature misery, or as if blindly beginning a search for their fathers&mdash;something
none of them will ever find. We laid a few coppers
in the cradles, and went on to the cigar-room.</p>

<p>It was much the same, excepting that the soberness of experience
there partially took the place of the giddiness rampant among the cigarette
girls. There were some appalling old crones among the thousand
individuals who rolled, chopped, gummed, and tied cigars at the
low tables distributed through a heavily groined stone hall choked
with thick pillars, and some six hundred or seven hundred yards in
length. Others, on the contrary, looked blooming and coquettish.
Many were in startling deshabille, resorted to on account of the intense
July heat, and hastened to draw pretty <i>pañuelos</i>
of variegated dye over
their bare shoulders when they saw us coming. Here, too, there was a
large nursery business being carried on, with a very damaged article of
child, smeary, sprawling, and crying. Nor was it altogether cheering to
observe now and then a woman who, having dissipated too late the
night before, sat fast asleep with her head in the cigar dust of the table.</p>

<p>"<i>Ojala!</i> May God do her work!" cried one of her friends. If he
did not, it was not because there was any lack of shrines in the factory.<a name="page_121" id="page_121"></a>
They were erected here and there against the wall, with gilt images
and candles arrayed in front of a white sheet, and occasionally the older
women knelt at their devotions before them. I don't object to the
shrines, but it struck me that a good <i>crèche</i> system for the children
might not come amiss.</p>

<p>
As to the factory-girls smoking cigarettes in public, it is an operatic
fiction: no such practice is common in Spain. And the beauty of these
Carmens has certainly been exaggerated. It may be remarked here
that, as an offset to occasional disappointment arising from such exaggerations,
all Spanish women walk with astonishing gracefulness, a
natural and elastic step; and that is their chief
advantage over women of other nations. Even
the chamber-maids of Sevilla were modelled on
a heroic, ancient-history plan, with big, supple
necks, and showed such easy power in their
movements that we half feared they might, in
tidying the rooms, pick us up by mistake and
throw us away somewhere to perish miserably
in a dust-heap. Why there should be so much
inborn ease and freedom expressed in the manner
of women who are guarded with Oriental
precautions, I don't know. Andalusian fathers
have, no doubt, the utmost confidence in their
daughters, but at the same time they save them
the trouble of taking care of themselves by putting
iron gratings on the windows. The <i>reja</i>,
the domestic gittern, is very common in Sevilla.
The betrothed suitor, if he is quite correct, must
hold his tender interviews with his mistress
through its forbidding bars. My companion
actually saw a handsome young fellow standing on the sidewalk, and
conducting one of these peculiar <i>tête-à-têtes</i>.

<p>Every house is, furthermore, provided with a <i>patio</i>. The façades,
as a rule, are monotonous and unspeakably plain, but the poorest dwelling
always has its airy court set with shrubs, and perhaps provided with
water. They are tiled, as most rooms are in Spain&mdash;a good precaution
against vermin, which unluckily is not infallible as regards fleas, which
search the traveller in Spain even more rigorously than the customs
officers or the Civil Guards. The flea is still and small, like the voice of
conscience, but that is the only moral thing about him. In the Peninsula<a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a>
I found him peculiarly unregenerate. As to these patios, the well-to-do
protect them from the open vestibule leading to the street by
gates of ornamental open iron, letting the air-currents play through the
unroofed court, and sometimes with movable screens behind the gate.
Chess-tables and coffee are carried out there in the evening, and the
music-room gives conveniently upon the cool central space.</p>

<p>In Sevilla, if you hear a shrill little bell tinkling in the street, do not
imagine that a bicycle is coming. One day a slight tintinnabulation
announced the approach of a funeral procession, headed by two gentlemen
wearing round caps and blue gowns, on which were sewed flaming
red hearts. One bore a small alms-basket; the other rung the bell to
attract contributions. It appears that this is the manner appointed for
sundry brothers who maintain the Caridad, a hospital for indigent old
men. The members, though pursuing their ordinary mode of life, are
banded for the support of the institution. Necessarily rich and aristocrats,
it matters not: when one of them dies, he must be buried by
means of offerings collected on the way to his grave. This Caridad, let
me add, was founded by Don Miguel de Manera, a friend of Don Juan,
and a reformed rake. His epitaph reads: "Here lie the ashes of the
worst man that ever was." I suspect a lingering vanity in that assertion,
but at any rate the tombstone tries hard <i>not</i> to lie.</p>

<p>Fashionable society, after recovering from its mid-day siesta, and before
going to the theatre or ball, turns itself out for an airing on Las
Delicias&mdash;"The Delights"&mdash;an arbored road running two or three miles
along the river-side. Nowhere can you see more magnificent horses
than there. Their race was formerly crossed with the finest mettle of
Barbary studs, and their blood, carried into Kentucky through Mexico,
may have had its share in the victories of Parole, Iroquois, and Foxhall.
A more strictly popular resort is the New Plaza, where citizens attend
a concert and fireworks twice a week in summer, and keep their distressed
babies up till midnight to see the fun. They are less demonstrative
than one would expect. An American reserve hangs over
them. Perfect informality reigns; they saunter, chat, and laugh without
constraint, yet their enjoyment is taken in a languid, half-pensive
way. In the various foot-streets where carriages do not appear&mdash;the
most notable of which is the winding one called simply Sierpes,
"The Serpents"&mdash;the same quietude prevails. Lined with attractive
bazar-like shops, and overhung by "sails" drawn from roof to roof,
which make them look like telescopic booths, these streets form
shady avenues down which figures glide unobtrusively: sometimes a<a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a>
cigarette girl in a pale geranium skirt, with a crimson shawl; sometimes
a lady in black, with lace-draped head; and perhaps an erroneous
man in a heavy blue cloak, saving up warmth for next winter; or a
peasant re-arranging his scarlet waist-cloth by tucking one end into his<a name="page_124" id="page_124"></a>
trousers, then turning round and round till he is wound up like a
watch-spring, and finally putting his needle-pointed knife into the folds,
ready for the next quarrel.</p>

<p>Once we caught sight of two belted forms with carbines stealing
across the alley, far down, as if for a flank movement against us. Oh,
horror! they were the Civil Guards, who were always blighting us at
the happiest moment. As they did not succeed in capturing us, we believed
they must have lost themselves in one of the <i>calles</i> that squirm
through the houses with no visible intention of ever coming out anywhere.
Velveteen wanted to go and look for their bones, thinking
they had perished of starvation, but I opportunely reflected that we
might ourselves be lost in the attempt. No wonder assassination has
been frequent in these narrow windings! Once astray in them, that
would be the easiest way out.</p>

<p>Shall we go to the Thursday-morning fair, which begins, in order to
avoid the great heats, at 6 <small>A.M.</small>? Come, then; and if we are up early,
we may pass on the way through the low-walled market, gay with
fruits, flowers, vegetables, where bread from Alcalá in the exact pattern
of buttercup blossoms is sold, and where, at a particularly bloody and
ferocious stall, butchers are dispensing the meat of bulls slaughtered at
the fights. The fair is held in Fair Street. A frantic miscellany of old
iron, of clothing, crockery, mat baskets, and large green pine-cones full
of plump seeds, which, when ripened, taste like butternuts, is set forth.
Full on the pavement is spread an array of second-hand shoes&mdash;the
proverbial dead men's, perhaps&mdash;temptingly blacked. Pale cinereous
earthen vessels, all becurled with raised patterns like intelligent wax-drippings,
but exceedingly well shaped, likewise monopolize the thoroughfare,
put in peril only by random dogs, which, having quarrelled
over the offal freely thrown into the street for them, sometimes race
disreputably through the brittle ware. At apt corners old women have
set up their frying-pans under Bedouin tents, and are cooking <i>calentitos</i>&mdash;long
coils of dough browned in hot olive oil&mdash;which are much sought
as a relish for the matutinal chocolate. Omnipresent, of course, are
those water stalls that, in Sevilla especially, acquire eminent dignity
by their row of stout jars, and their complicated cordage rigged across
from one house-top to another, so as to sustain shadowing canvas canopies.
There is a great crowd, but even the fair is comparatively quiet,
like the other phases of local life.</p>

<p>The absence of wagon-traffic in the town creates, notwithstanding
its reposeful character, a new relative scale of noises, and there is consequently<a name="page_125" id="page_125"></a>
good store of fretting attacks on the hearing in Sevilla. With
very early morning begins the deep clank of bells, under the chins of
asses that go the rounds to deliver domestic milk from their own udders.
There is no end of noise. Even in the elegant dining-room
where we ate, lottery-dealers would howl at us through the barred windows,
or a donkey outside would rasp our ears with his intolerable
braying. Then the street cries are incessant. At night the crowds
chafe and jabber till the latest hours, and after eleven the watchmen
begin their drawl of unearthly sadness, alternating with the occult and
remorseless industry of the mosquito; until, somewhere about dawn,
you drop perspiring into an oppressively tropical dream-land, with
the <i>sereno's</i> last cry ringing in your ears: "Hail, Mary, most pure!
Three o'clock has struck."</p>

<p>This is the weird tune to which he chants it:</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<a href="images/ilp125_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/ilp125_sml.jpg" width="404" height="47" alt="Musical notation: A&mdash;ve Ma&mdash;ri&mdash;a pur&mdash;is&mdash;si&mdash;ma!

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>A<small>N</small> English lady, conversing with a Sevillan gentleman who had
been making some rather tall statements, asked him: "Are you telling
me the truth?"</p>

<p>"Madam," he replied, gravely, but with a twinkle in his eye, "I am
an Andalusian!" At which the surrounding listeners, his fellow-countrymen,
broke into an appreciative laugh.</p>

<p>So proverbial is the want of veracity, or, to put it more genially, the
imagination, of these Southerners. Their imagination will explain also
the vogue of their brief, sometimes pathetic, yet never more than half-expressed,
scraps of song, which are sung with so much feeling throughout
the kingdom to crude barbaric airs, and loved alike by gentle and
simple. I mean the <i>Peteneras</i> and <i>Malagueñas</i>. There are others of
the same general kind, sung to a variety of dances; but the ruling tunes
are alike&mdash;usually pitched in a minor key, and interspersed with passionate
trills, long quavers, unexpected ups and downs, which it requires
no little skill to render. I have seen gypsy singers grow apoplectic
with the long breath and volume of sound which they threw into
these eccentric melodies amid thunders of applause. It is not a high
nor a cultivated order of music, but there lurks in it something consonant
with the broad, stimulating shine of the sun, the deep red earth,<a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a>
the thick, strange-flavored wine of the Peninsula; its constellated nights,
and clear daylight gleamed with flying gold from the winnowing-field.
The quirks of the melody are not unlike those of very old English ballads,
and some native composer with originality should be able to
expand their deep, bold, primitive ululations into richer, lasting forms.
The fantastic picking of the <i>mandurra</i> accompaniment reminds me of
Chinese music with which I have been familiar. Endless preludes and
interminable windings-up enclose the minute kernel of actual song; but
to both words and music is lent a repressed touching power and suggestiveness
by repeating, as is always done, the opening bars and first
words at the end, and then breaking off in mid-strain. For instance:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All the day I am happy,<br /></span>
<span class="ist">But at evening orison<br /></span>
<span class="ist">Like a millstone grows my heart.<br /></span>
<span class="ist">All the day I am happy." <span style="margin-left: 2em;">[<i>Limitless Guitar Solo.</i>]</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is like the never-ended strain of Schumann's "Warum?" The
words are always simple and few&mdash;often bald. One of the most popular
pieces amounts simply to this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Both Lagartijo and Frascuelo<br /></span>
<span class="ist">Swordsmen are of quality,<br /></span>
<span class="ist">Since when they the bulls are slaying&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="ist">O damsel of my heart!<br /></span>
<span class="ist">They do it with serenity.<br /></span>
<span class="ist">Both Lagartijo and Frascuelo<br /></span>
<span class="ist">Swordsmen are of quality."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But such evident ardor of feeling and such wealth of voice are
breathed into these fragments that they become sufficient. The people
supply from their imagination what is barely hinted in the lines. Under
their impassive exteriors they preserve memories, associations, emotions
of burning intensity, which throng to aid their enjoyment, as soon as
the muffled strings begin to vibrate and syllables of love or sorrow are
chanted. I recalled to a young and pretty Spanish lady one line,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Pajarito, tu que vuelas."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="nind">She flushed, fire came to her eyes, and with clasped hands she murmured,
"Oh, what a beautiful song it is!" Yet it contains only four
lines. Here is a translation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bird, little bird that wheelest<br /></span>

<p>Some of these little compositions are roughly humorous, and others
very grotesque, appearing to foreigners empty and ridiculous.</p>

<p>The following one has something of the odd imagery and clever inconsequence
of our negro improvisations:</p>

<span class="ist">I'm dead: pray for me, sweethearts!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was one evening in Granada when we sat in a company of
some two dozen people, and one after another of the ladies took her
turn in singing to the guitar of a little girl, a musical prodigy. But
they were all outdone by Cándida, the brisk, naïve, handsome serving-girl,
who was invited in, but preferred to stand outside the grated window,
near the lemon-trees and pomegranates, looking in, with a flower
in her hair, and pouring into the room her warm contralto&mdash;that voice
so common among Spanish peasant-women&mdash;which seemed to have
absorbed the clear dark of Andalusian nights when the stars glitter
like lance-points aimed at the earth. Through the twanging of the
strings we could hear the rush of water that gurgles all about the Alhambra;
and, just above the trees that stirred in the perfumed air without,
we knew the unsentinelled walls of the ancient fortress were frowning.
The most elaborate piece was one meant to accompany a dance
called the <i>Zapateado</i>, or "kick-dance." It begins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tie me, with my fiery charger,<br /></span>
<span class="ist">To your window's iron lattice.<br /></span>
<span class="ist">Though <i>he</i> break loose, my fiery charger,<br /></span>
<span class="ist">Me he cannot tear away;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="nind">and then passes into rhyme:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Much I ask of San Francisco,<br /></span>
<span class="ist">Much St. Thomas I implore;<br /></span>
<span class="ist">But of thee, my little brown girl,<br /></span>
<span class="ist">Ah, of thee I ask much more!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="nind">The singing went on:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In Triana there are rogues,<br /></span>
<span class="ist">And there are stars in heaven.<a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a><br /></span>
<span class="ist">Four and one rods away<br /></span>
<span class="ist">There lives, there lives a woman.<br /></span>
<span class="ist">Flowers there are in gardens,<br /></span>
<span class="ist">And beautiful girls in Sevilla."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nevertheless, we had been glad to leave Sevilla, especially since during
our stay an epidemic was in progress, graphically called "the minute,"
from its supposed characteristic of finishing off a victim ready for
the undertaker in exactly sixty
seconds after attacking him.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Granada
likewise seemed to be a good
deal occupied in burying themselves&mdash;a
habit which became
confirmed, no doubt, during the
wars and insurrections of their
ancestors, and is aided to-day
by bad sanitary arrangements.
We saw a dead man being carried
in the old Moorish way,
with his forehead bared to the
sky, a green wreath on his head,
his cold hands emerging from
the shroud in their last prayer-clasp,
and quite indifferent to
the pitiless sun that beat down
on them. But, perched as we
were on the Alhambra Hill,
high above the baking city,
such spectacles were transient
specks in the world of fascination
that infolded us.</p>

<p>Granada rests in what might
pass for the Happy Valley of
Rasselas, a deep stretch of thirty
miles, called simply the Vega,
and tilled from end to end on
a system of irrigation established
by the Moslem conquerors.
Rugged mountains, bastions of
a more than Cyclopean earthwork,<a name="page_131" id="page_131"></a>
girdle and defend it. To penetrate them you must leave the hot
rolling lands of the west, and confront steep heights niched here and
there for creamy-hued villages or deserted castles, and sentried by small
Moorish watch-towers rising like chessmen on the highest crests. The
olive-trees spread on wide slopes of tanned earth were like thick dots<a name="page_132" id="page_132"></a>
of black connected in one design, and seemed to suggest the possible
origin of Spanish lace. The shapes of the mountains, too, were extravagant.
One of the most singular, the <i>Peñon de los Enamorados</i>, near
Antequera, showed us by accident at a distance the exact profile of
George Washington, with every detail after Stuart, hewn out in mountain
size and looking directly up into the heavens from a position of
supine rigidity. Our first intimation of a near approach to Granada
was a long stretch of blanched folds showing through evening mistiness
in the southern sky, like the drapings of some celestial tabernacle, so
high up that they might have been clouds but for a certain persistent,
awful immobility that controlled them. Their spectral whiteness, detached
from the earth, hung, it is true, ten thousand feet above the sea-level;
but they were not clouds. They were the summits of the Sierra
Nevada, the great Snowy Range.</p>

<p>Twenty miles to the north of these frosty heights stands the Alhambra
Hill, shrouded in dark trees, and dominated by the Mountain
of the Sun. The names are significant&mdash;Snowy Range and Mountain
of the Sun&mdash;for the landscape that unrolls itself between these ridges
is a mixture of torrid glow and Alpine coldness. I stood in a hanging
garden delicious with aromatic growths, on the ramparts beside the
great Lookout Tower, the city lying like a calcareous deposit packed
in the gorge of the Darro's stream below. Across the Vega I beheld
that sandy pass of the hills through which Boabdil withdrew after his
surrender&mdash;the Last Sigh of the Moor. Fierce sunlight smote upon
me, spattering the leaves like metal in flux; but the snow-fields mantling
the blue wall of the Sierra loomed over the landscape so distinct
as to seem within easy hail, and I felt their breath in a sweet coolness
that drifted by from time to time. The other mountains were bare
and golden brown. But in their midst the mild Vega, inlaid with
curves of the River Genil, receded in breadths of alternate green orchard
and mellow rye, where distant villages are scattered "like white
antelopes at pasture," says Señor Don Contreras, the accomplished
curator of the Alhambra. It was not like a dream, for dreams are imitative;
nor like reality, for that is too unstable. It was blended of both
these, with a purely ideal strand. As I looked at the rusty red walls
and abraded towers palisading the hill, the surroundings became like
some miraculous web, and these ruins, concentring the threads, were
the shattered cocoon from which it had been spun.</p>

<p>The Alhambra was originally a village on the height, perhaps the
first local settlement, surrounded by a wall for defensive purposes.<a name="page_133" id="page_133"></a></p>

<p class="figcenter">

<p class="nind">The wall, which once united a system of thirty-seven towers, fringes the
irregular edges of the hill-top plateau, describing an enclosure like a
rude crescent lying east and west. At the west end the hill contracts
to an anvil point, and on this are grouped the works of the citadel Alcazaba,
governed by the huge square Lookout Tower. On a ridge
close to the south stand the Vermilion Towers, suspected of having
been mixed up with the Ph&oelig;nicians at an early epoch, but not yet
fully convicted by the antiquarians. The intervening glade receives a
steep road from the city, and is arcaded with elms and cherries of prodigious
size, sent over as saplings by the Duke of Wellington half a
century ago. There the nightingales sing in spring-time, and in summer
the boughs give perch to other songsters. Ramps lead up to the
top of the hill, and on the northern edge of its crescent, at the brink of
the Darro Valley, the Alhambra Palace proper is lodged.</p>

<p>We shall go in by the Gate of Justice, through a door-way running
up two-thirds of its tower's height, and culminating in a little horseshoe
arch, whereon a rude hand is incised&mdash;a favorite Mohammedan symbol
of doctrine. We pass a poor pictured oratory of the Virgin, and some
lance-rests of Ferdinand V., to worm our way through the grim passage
that cautiously turns twice before emerging through an arch of pointed
brick with enamellings on argil, into the open gravelled Place of the Reservoirs.
This is undermined by a fettered lake, generally attributed to
the Moors, but more probably made after Isabella's conquest. On the
right side, behind hedges and low trees, is reared that gray rectangular
Græco-Roman pile which Charles V. had the audacity to begin. His
palace is deservedly unfinished, yet its intrusion is effective. It makes
you think of the terror-striking helmet of unearthly size in the Castle
of Otranto, and looks indeed like a piece of mediæval armor flung down
here to challenge vainly the wise Arabian beauty of the older edifice.
To the Place of Reservoirs come in uninterrupted course all day the
tinkling and tasselled mules that carry back to the city jars of fresh
water, kept cool in baskets filled with leaves. And hither walk toward
sunset the <i>majos</i> and <i>majas</i>&mdash;dandies and coquettes&mdash;to stroll and gossip
for an hour, even as we saw them when we were lingering at the
northern parapet one evening and looking off through the clear air,
in which a million rose-leaves seemed to have dipped and left their
faint color.<a name="page_136" id="page_136"></a></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> veritable entrance to the Alhambra is now buried within some
later buildings added to the original. But it never, though Irving naturally
supposed the contrary, had a grand portal in the middle. Gorgeous
and showy means of ingress would not have suited the Oriental
mind. The exterior of the palace and all the towers is dull, blank, uncommunicative.
Their coating of muddy or ferruginous cement, marked
here and there by slim upright oblongs of black window spaces, was
not meant to reveal the luxury of loveliness concealed within. The
Moslem idea was to secrete the abodes of earthly bliss, nor even to hint
at them by outward signs of ostentation.</p>

<p>So the petty modern door cut for convenience is not wholly out of
keeping. It ushers one with a sudden surprise into the presence of
those marvels which have been for years a distant enticing vision. You
find yourself, in fact, wandering into the Alhambra courts as if by accident.
The first one&mdash;the Court of the Pond, or of the Myrtles&mdash;arrays
before us beauty enough and to spare. But it is only the beginning.
A long tank occupies the centre, brimmed with water from a rill that
gurgles, by day and night forever, with a low, half-laughing sob. Around
it level plates of white marble are riveted to the ground, and two hedges
of clipped myrtle border the placid surface. At the nearest end a double
gallery closes the court, imposed on seven arches so evenly rounded
as to emulate the Roman, but upheld by columns of amazing slenderness;
and in the spandrels are translucent arabesques inlaced with fillets,
radiating leaf-points, and loose knots. Above these blink some
square windows, shut as with frozen gauze by minute stone lattice-work,
over fifteen hundred twisted or cubed pieces being combined in
each. From there the women of the harem used to witness pageantries
and ceremonies that took place in the court; and over the veiled windows
is a roofed balcony repeating the lower arches, which would serve
for spectators not under ban of invisibility.</p>

</div>

<p>Various low doors lead from this Court of the Pond, giving sealed
intimation of what may lie beyond, but disclosing little. One turns
naturally, however, to the Hall of Ambassadors at the other end, in the
mighty Tower of Comares. The transverse arcade at the entrance is
roofed with shining vitreous-faced tiles of blue and white that also carry<a name="page_137" id="page_137"></a>
their stripes over the little cupola, to
which many similar ones doubtless formerly
surrounded the court, and in the
cloister underneath the inmates reclined on
divans glinting with rippled gold-thread and
embroidered with colored silks. Then comes
the anteroom, the Chamber of Benediction (usually
called of the Boat, on account of its long,
scooped ceiling), which is like the hollow of a capsized
boat suspended over us, and darkened with
deep lapis lazuli. There are some low doors in
the wall, meant for the humble approach of slaves
when serving their masters, or leading to lost
inner corridors and stairways now fallen into dust.
But the large central arch conducts at once into
the Hall of the Ambassadors, after we have
passed some niches in which of old were set encarmined
water-jars of sweet-scented clay. Beside these may have<a name="page_138" id="page_138"></a>
stood the carven racks for weapons of jewelled hilt and tempered
blade.</p>

<p>In the Chamber of Benediction begin those multitudinous arabesques
by which the Alhambra is most widely known. In the hall
beyond they flow out with unimpeded grace and variety over the walls
of an immensely high and nobly spacious apartment, pierced on three
sides at the floor level with arched <i>ajimez</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> windows halved by a thin,
flower-headed column, in the embrasures of which, enchased with cement,
are mouldings that overrun the groundwork in bands, curves, diamonds,
scrolls, delicate as the ribs of leaves or as vine tendrils. Within
these soft convolved lines, arranged to make the most florid detail tributary
to the general effect, Arabic characters twisted into the design
contain outbursts of poetry celebrating the edifice, the room itself.
"As if I were the arc of the rainbow," says one inscription in the hooped
door-way, "and the sun were Lord Abul Hachach." The windows
look forth upon the sheer northern fall of the hill; the waving tree-tops
scarcely rising to the balcony under the sills. They look upon old
Granada dozing below in the unmitigated sunlight, with here and there
the sculptured columns of a <i>patio</i> visible among the houses on the opposite
slope; and farther away the Sesame doors of gypsy habitations
cut into the solid mountain above the Darro. One of the most beautiful
of glimpses about the Alhambra is that through the east window,
looking along the parapet gallery to the Toilet Tower. Precipitous
masonry plunges down among trees that shoot incredibly high, as if incited
by the lines of the building; and on the Mountain of the Sun the
irregular lint-white buildings of the Generalife&mdash;an old retreat of Moorish
sovereigns and nobles&mdash;are lodged among cypresses and orange
thickets. Within the hall itself all is cool, subdued, and breezy, and
the smooth vault of the larch-wood ceiling, still dimly rich with azure
and gold, spans the area high overhead like a solemn twilight sky at
night.</p>

<p>It was in this Tower of Comares that the last King of Granada,
Boabdil, was imprisoned with his mother, Ayeshah, by his stormy and
fatuous father, Muley Abul Hassan, owing to the rival influence of the
Morning Star, Zoraya, Hassan's favorite wife. Boabdil escaped, being
let down to the ground by the scarfs of his mother and her female attendants.
Years after, when he had succeeded to the throne for a brief
and hapless reign, <i>El Rey Chico</i> (The Little King), as the Spaniards<a name="page_139" id="page_139"></a>
called him, was led by his mother into the Hall of Ambassadors after
he had capitulated to Ferdinand and Isabella. Silently she made its
circuit with him, and then, overcome with the bitterness of loss, she
cried: "Behold what thou art giving up, and remember that all thy
forefathers died kings of Granada, but in thee the kingdom dies!"</p>

</p>

<p>The Hall of Ambassadors is assigned to the epoch of the caliphate.
Certainly the Court of Lions is invested with a somewhat different character.
Its arches are more pointed, more nearly Gothic, and are hung
upon a maze of exquisitely slight columns, presenting, as you look in,<a name="page_140" id="page_140"></a>
an opulent confusion of crinkled curves and wavering ellipses, bordered
with dropping points and brief undulations that look like festoons of
heavy petrified lace: as lace, heavy; but as architecture, light. There
is incalculable diversity in the proportions, unevenness in the grouping
of the pillars, irregularity in the cupolas; yet through all persists an
unsurpassable harmony, a sensitive equilibrium. The Hall of Justice,
which opens from it, and contains&mdash;contrary to Mohammedan principles&mdash;some
mysterious early Italian frescoes depicting Moorish and
Christian combats, is a grotto of stalactites. All this part of the palace,
one would say, might have sprung from the spray of those hidden
canals which brought the snow-water hither, spouting up, then falling
and crystallizing in shapes of arrested motion; so perfect is the geometrical
balance, so suave are the flowing lines. The un-Moorish lions sustaining
the central basin are meagre and crude, and the size of the
court is disappointing; but it is a miniature labyrinth of beauty. From
one side you may pass into the Hall of the Abencerages, under the
fine star-shaped roof of which a number of those purely Arab-blooded
knights are said to have been, at the instigation of their half-Christian
rivals, the Zegris, assembled at a banquet and then murdered. An invitation
to dinner in those days was a doubtful compliment, which a
gentleman had to think twice about before accepting.</p>

<p>On the other side lies the access to the Chamber of the Two Sisters,
a lovely apartment, having a grooved bed in the marble floor for a current
of water to course through and run out under the zigzag-carven
cedar door. Everything is exactly as you would have it, and you seem
to be straying through embodied reveries of Bagdad and Damascus.
But it would be futile to describe the myriad traceries of these rooms;
the bevelled entablatures, the elastic ceilings, displaying an order and
multiplicity of tiny relief as systematic as the cells and tissues in a cut
pomegranate; or the dadoes of colored tiles, still dimly glistening with
glaze, and chameleonizing the base of the partitions. The culmination
of microscopic refinement comes, with a sigh of relief from such an
overplus of sensuous delight, in the boudoir of Lindaraxa, which overlooks
from a superb embayed window a little oasis of fountained court,
blooming with citrons and lemons, and bedded with violets. That
small garden, green and laughing, and interspersed with dark flower-mould,
lies clasped in the branching wings of masonry, as simple and
refreshing as a dew-drop. It is shut in on the other side by some mediæval
rooms fitted up in heavy oak panelling for Philip V. and his second
bride, Elisabetta, when with rare judgment they chose this Islamitic<a name="page_141" id="page_141"></a><a name="page_142" id="page_142"></a><a name="page_143" id="page_143"></a>
spot for their honey-moon&mdash;a crescent, I suppose. It was in one
of these rooms&mdash;the Room of the Fruits&mdash;that, to quote Señor Contreras
again, "the celebrated poet Washington Irving harbored, composing
there his best works." From which it will be inferred that the
gallant Spaniard has not probed deeply the "Knickerbocker History
of New York," the "Sketch-book," and the "Life of Washington."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

</p>

<p>One may prolong one's explorations to the Queen's Toilet Tower&mdash;who
"the queen" was remains decidedly vague&mdash;poised like a lofty
palm on the verge commanding the Darro gorge. In one corner of its
engirdling colonnade are some round punctures, through which perfume
was wafted to saturate the queen's garments while she was dressing.
Or one may descend to the Baths, vaulted in below the general
level. Their antechamber is the only portion which has been completely
restored to its pristine magnificence of blue and gold, vermilion-flecked
and overspreading the polygonal facets of stucco-work. I could
imagine the Sultan coming there with stately step to be robed for
the bath by female slaves, then passing on wooden clogs into the inner
chamber of heated marble, and at a due interval emerging to take his
place on one of the inclined slabs in an outer alcove, enveloped in a
<i>tcherchef</i>&mdash;his head bound with a soft silk muffler&mdash;there to devote
himself to rest, sweetmeats, and lazy conversation.</p>

<p>The Alhambra Palace is remarkable as being more Persian than
Turkish, and reproducing many features that crop up in the architecture
of India, Syria, Arabia, and Turkey, yet incorporating them in an
independent total. The horseshoe arch is not the prevailing one, though
it occurs often enough to renew and deepen the impression of its unique
effect. What makes this arch so adroitly significant of the East? Possibly
the fact that it suggests a bow bent to the extremest convexity.
It is easy to imagine stretched between the opposite sides a bow-string&mdash;that
handy implement of conjugal strangulation which no Sultan's
family should be without.</p>

<p>Part of the populous ancient settlement on the hill still exists in a<a name="page_144" id="page_144"></a>
single street outside of the palace, now inhabited by a more respectable
population than that riffraff of silk-weavers, vagabonds, potters, smugglers,
and broken-down soldiers who flourished there half a century
since. A church stands among the dwellings. Strolling up the street
one moonlit night, we bought some blue and white wine-pitchers of
Granada-ware at a little drinking-shop, and saw farther on a big circle
of some twenty people sitting together in the open air&mdash;one of those
informal social clubs called <i>tertulias</i>, common among neighbors and
intimate friends in all ranks of Spanish society. At another spot a man
was sleeping in the moonlight on a cot beside the parapet, with his two
little Indian-looking boys dreaming on a sheet laid over the ground.
Mateo Ximenes, the son of Irving's "Son of the Alhambra," lives in
this quarter, officiating as a guide. Thanks to "Geoffrey Crayon" he is
prosperous, and has accordingly built a new square house which is the
acme of commonplace. Beyond the street, across some open ground
where figs and prickly-pears are growing, stands the Tower of the
Captive, where Isabella de Solis, a Christian princess, being captured,
was imprisoned, and became the wife of Abul Hassan. She was, in
fact, the Zoraya who became Ayeshah's rival. Dense ivy mats the
wall between this and the Tower of the Princesses&mdash;a structure utilized
by Irving in one of his prettiest tales. Both towers are incrusted interiorly
with a perfection rivalling the palace chambers, and perhaps even
more enchanting, but no vestige of coloring is left in them. To me
this wan aspect of the walls is more poetic than any restoration of the
original emblazonments. The pale white-brown surface seems compounded
of historic ashes, and is imbued with a pathos,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Like a picture when the pride<br /></span>
<span class="ist">Of its coloring hath died,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="nind">which one would be loath to lose.</p>

<p>The sunlit and vine-clad decrepitude that sits so lightly on this
magic stronghold&mdash;this "fortress and mansion of joy," as one of the
mural mottoes calls it&mdash;is among its main charms. The most bitter
opponent of any Moorish return to power in Granada would, I think,
be the modern æsthetic tourist. I rambled frequently close under the
old rufous-mottled walls, from which young trees sprout up lustily, and
enjoyed their decay almost as much as I did the palace. At one point
near the Tower of Seven Stories (which has never quite recovered from
being blown up by the French) there was a long stretch of garden where
phlox and larkspur and chrysanthemums, that would not wait for autumn,<a name="page_145" id="page_145"></a>
grew rank among the fruit-trees. A Moorish water-pipe near the
top of the wall had broken, and, bursting through the brick-work, its
current had formed a narrow cascade that tumbled into the garden
through wavering loops of maiden-hair, and over mosses or water-plants
which it had brought into life on the escarpment. Grapes and figs rose
luxuriantly about rings of box enclosing fountains, and at sunset some
shaft of fire would level itself into the greenery, striking the gorgeous
pomegranate blossoms into prominence, like scarlet-tufted birds' heads.
All day there was a loud chir of cicadas, and a rain of white-hot light
sifted through the leaves. But at night everything died away except
the rush of water, which grew louder and louder till it filled the whole
air like a ghostly warning. I used to wake long after midnight, and
hear nothing but this chilling whisper, unless by chance some gypsies
squatted on the road were singing <i>Malagueñas</i>, or the strange, piercing
note of the tree-toad that haunts the hill rung out in elfin and inhuman
pipings of woe. For the builders who laid them here these running
streams make a fit memorial&mdash;unstable as their power that has slipped
away, yet surviving them, and remaining here as an echo of their voices,
a reminder of the absent race which not for an hour can one forget in
Granada.</p>

<p>But the supreme spell of the Alhambra reserves itself for moonlight.
When the Madonna's lamp shone bright amid the ingulfing shadows
of the Tower of Justice, while its upper half was cased in steely radiance,
we passed in by Charles's Palace, where the moon, shining through
the roofless top, made a row of smaller moons in the circular upper
windows of the dark gray wall. In the Court of the Pond a low gourd-like
umbellation at the north end sparkled in diamond lustre beneath
the quivering rays; while the whole Tower of Comares behind it repeated
itself in the gray-green water at our feet, with a twinkle of stars
around its reversed summit. This image, dropped into the liquid
depth, has dwelt there ever since its original was reared, and it somehow
idealized itself into a picture of the tower's primitive perfection.
The coldness of the moonlight on the soft cream-colored plaster, in this
warm, stilly air, is peculiarly impressive. As for sound, absolutely none
is heard but that of dripping water; nor did I ever walk through a profounder,
more ghost-like silence than that which eddied in Lindaraxa's
garden around the fountain, as it mourned in silvery monotones of
neglected grief. The moon-glare, coming through the lonely arches,
shaped gleaming cuirasses on the ground, or struck the out-thrust
branches of citron-trees, and seemed to drip from them again in a dazzle<a name="page_146" id="page_146"></a>
of snowy fire; and when I discovered my two companions looking
out unexpectedly from a pointed window, they were so pale in the
brilliance which played over them that for a moment I easily fancied
them white-stoled apparitions from the past. As we glanced from the
Queen's Peinador, where the black trees of the shaggy ascent sprung
toward us in swift lines or serpentine coilings as if to grasp at us, we
saw long shadows from the towers thrown out over the sleeping city,
which, far below, caked together its squares of hammered silver, dusked
over by the dead gray of roofs that did not reflect the light. But
within the Hall of Ambassadors reigned a gloom like that of the grave.
Gleams of sharp radiance lay in the deep embrasures without penetrating;
and, at one, the intricacies of open-work above the arch were
mapped in clear figures of light on a space of jet-black floor. Another
was filled nearly to the top by the blue, weirdly luminous image of a
mountain across the valley. Through all these openings, I thought,
the spirits of the departed could find entrance as easily as the footless
night breeze. I wonder if the people who lived in this labyrinth of art
ever smiled? In the palpitating dusk, robed men and veiled women
seemed to steal by with a rustle no louder than that of their actual
movement in life; silk hangings hung floating from the walls; scented
lamps shed their beams at moments through the obscurity, and I saw
the gleam of enamelled swords, the shine of bronze candlesticks, the
blur of colored vases in the corners; the <i>kasidas</i> of which poetry-loving
monarchs turned the pages. But in such a place I could not imagine
laughter. I felt inclined to prostrate myself in the darkness before I
know not what power of by-gone yet ever-present things&mdash;a half tangible
essence that expressed only the solemnity of life and the presentiment
of change.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>I<small>T</small> is not surprising that Isabella the Catholic, who had so completely
thrown her heart into the conquest of Granada, should have
wished to be buried in that city, though dying far away. Her marble
semblance rests beside that of Ferdinand in the Royal Chapel, which
serves as vestibule to the ugly Renaissance cathedral. The statues are
peculiarly impressive, and sleep on high sepulchres of alabaster, beautifully
chased. Both of them are placed with their heads where, if sentient,
they might contemplate the astonishing reredos of the altar&mdash;a
wooden mass piled to the roof, and containing many niches filled by figures<a name="page_147" id="page_147"></a>
carved, gilded, and painted with flesh-color. Among them is John
the Baptist standing upright, with blood gushing from his severed neck,
while the head which has just quitted it is being presented on a charger
to Herodias's daughter. There are other hideous things in this strange
and brutal church ornament, which is a museum of monstrosities; but
parts of it depict the triumphs of the royal pair, and it was no doubt
accordant with their taste. Their bodies lie in a black vault under the
floor, which we visited by the light of a single candle. Two long bulks
of lead, with a simple letter F. on one and an I. on the other; that was
all that marked the presence of two great monarchs' earthly part.
Juana the Mad, Charles V.'s mother, rests in another leaden casket&mdash;the
poor Queen, whom her famous son probably reported crazy for his
own political purposes, but whose supposed mania of watching her dead
husband's body, in jealous fear that he could still be loved by other
women, has been effectively treated in Padilla's picture. Her husband,
Philip the Fair, lies on the opposite side. Hardly could there be a
more impressive contrast than that between this tomb under the soft,
musty shadows of the chapel&mdash;all that is left of the conqueror&mdash;and
that glorious sun-imbued ruin on the hill&mdash;all that is left of the conquered.
Two mighty forces met and clashed around Granada in 1492;
and, when the victory was won, both receded like spent waves, leaving
the Alhambra to slow burial in rubbish and oblivion, under which
Washington Irving literally rediscovered it. How fine a coincidence
that the very spot from which Isabella finally despatched Columbus on
his great quest should owe so much to a son of the new continent
which Columbus discovered!</p>

<p>Another edifice of no small interest, although seldom heard of at a
distance, is La Cartuja, the Carthusian church and monastery, lying
upon a hill-slope called Hinadamar, across the city and on its outskirts,
due west from the Alhambra. The monks who formerly occupied it
have, in common with those of other orders, been driven out of Spain;
so that we approached the church-steps through an old arched gate-way,
no longer guarded, and by way of a grass-grown enclosure that bore
the appearance of complete neglect. The interior, however, is very
well preserved. It was curious to walk through it, under the guidance
of a pursy old woman, and, afterward, of the lame sacristan, who did his
best with chattering gossip to rob the place of whatever sanctity remained
to it. The refectory (fitly inhabited by an echo) stands bare
and empty, save for the reading-desk, from which the monks used to
be refreshed with Scripture while at their meals; and on the wall at<a name="page_148" id="page_148"></a>
one end of this long, high hall hangs apparently a wooden cross, which
at first it is impossible to believe is only painted there. The barren,
round-arched cloisters are frescoed with an interminable series of scenes
by Cotan, the same artist who painted the cross; and in this case he
was given a free commission, of which he availed himself to the utmost
in depicting the most distressing incidents of Carthusian martyrology.
Especially does he seem to have delighted in the persecutions inflicted
by English Protestants under Henry VIII. on San Bruno, the founder
of this order. How strange the conception of a holy and exalted life
which led men in religious retirement to keep before their eyes, in
these corridors meant for mild exercise and recreation, representations
so full of blood and horror! In fact, one cannot escape the impression,
stamped more vividly on the mind here in Granada than anywhere else,
except perhaps in Toledo, that Christianity in Spain meant barbarism.
But where it was released from the immediate purposes of ecclesiastic
dogma, Christian art showed a taste not so much barbarous as barbaric,
and the results of its activity were often beautiful. In this same monastery
is a splendid example of that tendency. The church is not remarkably
fine or impressive; but the sacristy is a marvel of sumptuous
decoration, and decoration very peculiar in kind. Its walls are wholly
incased in a most effective species of green and white marble, cut in
smooth, polished slabs, the natural veinings of which present grotesque
resemblances to human and other forms, which are somewhat trivially
insisted upon by the custodian and guide, and should be allowed to
lose themselves in the general richness of aspect. The great doors of
this sacristy are inlaid with ebony, silver, mother-of-pearl, and tortoise-shell,
in designs of much intricacy and richness; and all around the
room (which is provided with an altar, so that it becomes a sort of sub-church
or chapel, adjoining the main church) are low closets fitted into
the wall. These were originally used for holding the vestments of the
brotherhood. Made of sweet-scented cedar, they are adorned on the
outside with the same inlaid work that appears on the doors. The
dim, veiled shimmer of the mother-of-pearl, the delicate, translucent
browns of the tortoise-shell, and the wandering threads of silver, form
a decorative surface wonderful in its refinement, its perfection of elegance.
I scarcely know how to give an idea of its appearance, unless
I say that it was somewhat as if layers of spider-webs had been spread,
with all their mystery of exact curves and angles, over the wood-work,
and then had had their fibres changed by some magic into precious and
enduring materials. The frail but well-adjusted fabric has outlasted<a name="page_149" id="page_149"></a>
the dominion of those for whose selfish and secluded pride of worship
it was made; and, seeing it, one may pardon them some of their mistakes.
It is pleasant also to find that the art of making this inlay, after
having long fallen out of use, has been revived in Granada; for in these
days of enlightened adaptation and artistic education there seems to
be no reason why such a handicraft should be lost or even confined
to Spain.</p>

<p>The gypsies of Granada are disappointing, apart from their peculiar
quivering dance, performed by <i>gitanas</i> in all Spanish cities under the
name of <i>flamenco</i>.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Their hill-caves, so operative with one's curiosity
when regarded from across the valley, gape open in such dingy, sour,
degraded foulness on a nearer view, that I found no amount of theory
would avail to restore their interest. Yet some of the fortune-telling
women are spirited enough, and the inextinguishable Romany spark
smoulders in their black eyes. Perhaps it was an interloping drop of
Celtic blood that made one of them say to me, "Señorito, listen. I
will tell you your fortune. But I speak French&mdash;<i>I come from Africa!</i>"
And to clinch the matter she added, "You needn't pay me if every
word of the prediction isn't true!" Much as I had heard of the Spanish
bull, I never knew until then how closely it resembled the Irish
breed.</p>

<p>Fortuny's model, Marinero, who lives in a burrow on the Alhambra
side, occasionally starts up out of the earth in a superb and expensive
costume, due to the dignity of his having been painted by Fortuny.
Dark as a negro, with a degree of luminous brown in his skin, and very
handsome, he plants himself immovably in one spot to sell photographs
of himself. His nostrils visibly dilate with pride, but he makes no
other bid for custom. He expands his haughty nose, and you immediately
buy a picture. Velveteen chanced upon Marinero's daughter,
and got her to pose. When he engaged her she was so delighted that
she took a rose from her hair and presented it to him, with a charming,
unaffected air of gratitude, came an hour before the time, and waited
impatiently. She wore a wine-colored skirt, if I remember, a violet
jacket braided with black, and a silk neckerchief of dull purple-pink
silk. But that was not enough: a blue silk kerchief also was wound
about her waist, and in among her smooth jet locks she had tucked a
vivid scarlet flower. The result was perfect, for the rich pale-brown of<a name="page_150" id="page_150"></a>
her complexion could harmonize anything; and in Spain, moreover,
combinations of color that appear too harsh elsewhere are paled and
softened by the overpowering light.</p>

</p>

<p>Episodes like these tinged our dreams of the Alhambra with novel
dashes of living reality. Even the tedious bustle of a Spanish town,
too, has its attractions. The moving figures on the steep Albaycin
streets, that perpetually break into flights of steps; the blocks of
pressed snow brought in mule panniers every night from the Sierra to
cool sugar-water and risadas of orange at the cafés; peasants coming
in to the beautiful old grain market with gaudy mantles over their
shoulders, stuffing into their sashes a variety of purchases, and becoming
corpulent with a day's transactions; the patient efforts of shop-keepers<a name="page_151" id="page_151"></a>
to water the main street, Zacatin, with a pailful at a time&mdash;all
this was amusing to watch. The Generalife was another source of
pleasure, for in its topmost loggia one may sit like a bird, with the Alhambra
spread out below in all the distinctness of a raised map. In
the saloons of the Generalife hang the portraits of the Moorish and
the Christian ancestors of the present owner. Their direct descendant
is a woman; therefore she has married an Italian count, and flitted
from this ideal, quite unparalleled eyry, returning to her ancestral
home only at rare intervals.</p>

<p>There came an hour when we too flitted. To oblige an eccentric
time-table we had to get up at dawn; but the last glimpse of the Alhambra
at that early hour was a compensation. The dim red towers
already began to soften into a reminiscence under this tender blending
of moonlight and morning; but a small constellation in the east
sparkled on the blue like a necklace of diamonds, and Saturn still
flamed above the mountains, growing momently larger, as if it were a
huge topaz in the turban of some giant Moor advancing in the early
stillness to reclaim the Alhambra throne.<a name="page_152" id="page_152"></a></p>

it to be like? For my part, I had expected
something wild, free, and fantastic;
something in harmony with moonlight,
the ragged shadows of trees, and
the flicker of a rude camp-fire. Nothing
could have been wider of the mark.
The <i>flamenco</i>&mdash;that dance of the gypsies,
in its way as peculiarly Spanish as
the church and the bull-ring, and hardly
less important&mdash;is of Oriental
origin, and preserves the impassive
quality, the suppressed, tantalized
sensuousness belonging
to Eastern performances in the
saltatory line. It forms a popular
entertainment in cafés of
the lower order throughout the
southern provinces, from Madrid
all the way around to Valencia,
in Sevilla and Malaga, and is
gotten up as a select and expensive
treat for travellers at
Granada. But we saw it at its best in Malaga.
</p>

<p>We were conducted, about eleven o'clock in the evening, to a roomy,
rambling, dingy apartment in the crook of an obscure and dirty street,
where we found a large number of sailors, peasants, and <i>chulos</i> seated
drinking at small tables, with a very occasional well-dressed citizen or
two here and there. In one corner was a stage rising to the level of
our chins when we were seated, which had two fronts, like the Shakspearian<a name="page_153" id="page_153"></a>
stage in pictures, so that spectators on the side might have a
fair chance, and be danced to from time to time. On this sat about a
dozen men and women, the latter quite as much Spanish as gypsy, and
some of them dressed partially in tights, with an affectation of sailors'
or pages' costume in addition. At Madrid and Sevilla their sisters in
the craft wore ordinary feminine dresses, and looked the possessors of
more genuine Romany blood.</p>

<p>But here, too, the star <i>danseuse</i>, the chief mistress of the art <i>flamenco</i>,
was habited in the voluminous calico skirt which Peninsular propriety
prescribes for this particular exhibition, thereby doing all it can to conceal
and detract from the amazing skill of muscular movement involved.
A variety of songs and dances with guitar accompaniments, some effective
and others tedious, preceded the gypsy performance. I think we
listened nearly half an hour to certain disconsolate barytone wailings,
which were supposed to interpret the loves, anxieties, and other emotions
of a <i>contrabandista</i>, or smuggler, hiding from pursuit in the mountains.
Judging from the time at his disposal for this lament, the smuggling
business must indeed be sadly on the decline. The whole entertainment
was supervised by a man precisely like all the chiefs of these
troupes in Spain. Their similarity is astounding; even their features
are almost identical: when you have seen one, you have seen all his
fellows, and know exactly what they will do. He may be a little older
or younger, a little more gross or less so, but he is always clean-shaven
like the other two sacred types&mdash;the bull-fighter and the priest&mdash;and
his face is in every case weakly but good-humoredly sensual. But what
does he <i>do</i>? Well, nothing. He is the most important personage on
the platform, but he does not pretend to contribute to the programme
beyond an exclamation of encouragement to the performers at intervals.
He is a Turveydrop in deportment at moments, and always a
Crummles in self-esteem. A few highly favored individuals as they
come into the café salute him, and receive a condescending nod in return.
Then some friend in the audience sends up to him a glass of
chamomile wine, or comes close and offers it with his own hand. The
leader invariably makes excuses, and without exception ends by taking
the wine, swallowing a portion, and gracefully spitting out the rest at
the side of the platform. He smokes the cigars of admiring acquaintances,
and throws the stumps on the stage. All the while he carries
in his hand a smooth, plain walking-stick, with which he thumps time
to the music when inclined.</p>

<br />
<span class="caption">GYPSY DANCE.</span>
</p>

<p>At last the moment for the <i>flamenco</i> arrives. The leader begins to<a name="page_154" id="page_154"></a>
beat monotonously on the boards, just as our Indians do with their tomahawks,
to set the rhythm; the guitars strike into their rising and falling
melancholy strain. Two or three women chant a weird song, and
all clap their hands in a peculiar measure, now louder, now fainter, and
with pauses of varying length between the emphatic reports. The
dancer has not yet risen from her seat; she seems to demand encouragement.
The others call out, "Ollé!"&mdash;a gypsy word for "bravo!"&mdash;and
smile and nod their heads at her to draw her on. All this excites
in you a livelier curiosity, a sort of suspense. "What can be coming
now?" you ask. Finally she gets up, smiling half scornfully; a light
comes into her eyes; she throws her head back, and her face is suffused
with an expression of daring, of energy, and strange pride. Perhaps it
is only my fancy, but there seems to creep over the woman at that instant
a reminiscence of far-off and mysterious things; her face, partially
lifted, seems to catch the light of old traditions, and to be imbued with
the spirit of something belonging to the past, which she is about to<a name="page_155" id="page_155"></a>
revive. Her arms are thrown upward, she snaps her fingers, and draws
them down slowly close before her face as far as the waist, when, with
an easy waving sideward, the "pass" is ended, and the arms go up
again to repeat the movement. Her body too is in motion now, only
slightly, with a kind of vibration; and her feet, unseen beneath the
flowing skirt, have begun an easy, quiet, repressed rhythmical figure.
So she advances, her face always forward, and goes swiftly around a
circle, coming back to the point where she began, without appearing
to step. The music goes on steadily, the cries of her companions become
more animated, and she continues to execute that queer, aimless,
yet dimly beckoning gesture with both arms&mdash;never remitting it nor
the snapping of her fingers, in fact, until she has finished the whole
affair. Her feet go a little faster; you can hear them tapping the floor
as they weave upon it some more complicated measure; but there is
not the slightest approach to a springing tendency. Her progress is
sinuous; she glides and shuffles, her soles quitting the boards as little
as possible&mdash;something between a clog dance and a walk, perfect in
time, with a complexity in the exercise of the feet demanding much
skill. She treats the performance with great dignity; the intensity of
her absorption invests it with a something almost solemn.</p>

<p>Forward again! She gazes intently in front as she proceeds, and
again as she floats backward, looking triumphant, perhaps with a spark
of latent mischief in her eyes. She stamps harder upon the floor; the
sounds follow like pistol reports. The regular <i>clack</i>, <i>clack-clack</i> of the
smitten hands goes on about her, and the cries of the rest increase in
zest and loudness.</p>

<p>"Ollé! ollé!"</p>

<p>"Bravo, my gracious one!"</p>

<p>"Muy bien! muy bien!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Live the queen of the ants!" shouts the leader. And
the audience roars at his eccentric phrase.</p>

<p>The dancer becomes more impassioned, but in no way more violent.
Her body does not move above the hips. It is only the legs that twist
and turn and bend and stamp, as if one electric shock after another
were being sent downward through them. Every few minutes her activity
passes by some scarcely noted gradation into a subtly new phase,
but all these phases are bound together by a certain uniformity of restraint
and fixed law. Now she almost comes to a stand-still, and
then we notice a quivering, snaky, shuddering motion, beginning at the
shoulders and <i>flowing</i> down through her whole body, wave upon wave,<a name="page_156" id="page_156"></a>
the dress drawn tighter with one hand showing that this continues
downward to her feet. Is she a Lamia in the act of undergoing metamorphosis,
a serpent, or a woman? The next moment she is dancing,
receding&mdash;this time with smiles, and with an indescribable air of invitation
in the tossing of her arms. But the crowning achievement is
when the hips begin to sway too, and, while she is going back and forward,
execute a rotary movement like that of the bent part of an auger.
In fact, you expect her to bore herself into the floor and disappear.
Then all at once the stamping and clapping and the twanging strings
are stopped, as she ceases her formal gyrations: she walks back to her
seat like one liberated from a spell, and the whole thing is over.</p>

<p>Velveteen and I came to Malaga direct from the Alhambra. The
transition was one from the land of the olive to that of the palm.
When we left Granada, an hour after daybreak, the slopes of the Sierra
Nevada below the snow-line were softly overspread with rose and gold
upon the blue, and the unmatchably pale bright yellow-white of the
grain fields along the valley was spotted with the dark clumps of olive-trees,
at a distance no bigger than cabbages. The last thing we saw
was a sturdy peasant in knee-breeches and laced legs, with a tattered
cloak flung around his chest and brought over the left shoulder in
stately folds, that gave him the mien of a Roman senator, and put to
shame our vulgar railroad plans. As the day grew, the hills in shadow
melted into a warm citron hue, and those lifting their faces to the light
were white as chalk, with faint blue shadows down in the clefts.</p>

<p>It was in this same neighborhood that we saw peasant women in
trousers doing harvest-work. To the enormity of donning the male
garb they added the hardihood of choosing for the color of their trousers
a bright sulphur-yellow. My friend the artist, I believe, secretly
envied them this splendor denied to men; and in truth they would
make spirited and effective material for a painter. Their yellow legs
descended from a very short skirt of blue or vermilion, a mere concession
to prejudice, for it was mostly caught up and pinned in folds to
keep it out of the way. Above that the dress and figure were feminine;
the colored kerchief around the throat, and the gay bandanna
twisted around the dark loose hair under a big straw hat, finishing off
the whole person as something dashing, free, novel, and yet quite natural
and not unwomanly.</p>

<p>An old man at Bobadilla offered us some <i>palmitos</i>&mdash;pieces of pith
from the palm-trees, tufted with a few feathery young leaves, and considered
a delicacy when fresh. It had a bitter-sweet, rather vapid taste,<a name="page_157" id="page_157"></a>
but I hailed it as a friendly token from the semi-tropical region we were
approaching. So I bought one, and my companion presented the old
man with some of the lunch we had brought; whereupon the shrivelled
merchant, with a courtesy often met with in Spain, insisted upon his
taking a <i>palmito</i> as a present. Thus, bearing our victorious palm leaves,
we moved forward to meet the palms themselves. The train rumbled
swiftly through twelve successive tunnels, giving, between them, magnificent
glimpses of deep wild gorges; fantastic rocks piled up in all conceivable
shapes, like a collection of giant crystals arranged by a mad-man,
amid mounds of gray and slate-colored clay pulverized by the
heat, and reduced absolutely to ashes. The last barrier of the Alpujarras
was passed, and we rushed out upon lower levels, immense and
fertile vales, dense with plantations of orange and lemon, interspersed
with high-necked, musing palms and brilliant thickets of pomegranate.
Through the hot earth in which these plantations were placed ran the
narrow canals, not more than two feet wide, containing those streams
of milky water from the snow-fields on which all the vegetation of the
region depends.</p>

<p>It is of this and the neighboring portions of Spain that Castelar, in
one of his recent writings, says: "The wildest coasts of our peninsula&mdash;those
coasts of Almeria, Alicante, Murcia, where the fruits of various
zones are yielded&mdash;compensate for their great plenty by years of desolation
comparable only to those described in the chronicles of the
Middle Ages, and suffered in the crowded lands of the Orient.... The
mountains of those districts, which breathe the incense of thyme and
lavender, are carpeted with silky grasses, and full of mines, and intersected
by quarries. The <i>honduras</i>, or valleys, present the palm beside
the pomegranate, the vine next to the olive, barley and sugar-cane in
abundance, orange orchards and fields of maize; in fine, all the fruits
of the best zones, incomparable both as to quantity and quality. The
azure waves of their sea, resembling Venetian crystals, contain store of
savory fish; and the equality of the temperature, the purity of the air,
the splendor of the days, and the freshness, the soothing calm of the
nights, impart such enchantment that, once habituated to them, in
whatever other part of the world you may be, you feel yourself, alas!
overcome by irremediable nostalgia." The eloquent statesman has
something to say, likewise, of the people. "Nowhere does there exist
in such vitality," he declares, "the love of family and the love of labor....
Property is very much divided; the customs are exceedingly democratic;
there exist few proprietors who are not workers, and few workers<a name="page_158" id="page_158"></a>
who are not proprietors." Democratic the country is, no doubt;
too much so, perhaps, for peace under monarchical rule. These fervid,
fertile coast lands, containing the gardens of Spain, are also the home
of revolution.<a name="page_159" id="page_159"></a></p>

</p>

<p>The north was the Carlist stronghold; the south furnished in every
city a little Republican volcano. Nor is the simple, patriarchal state
of society which Castelar indicates quite universal. Here, as in other
provinces, we found luxurious wealth flourishing in the heart of pitiable
poverty. The Governor of Malaga was on our train, and a delightfully
honest and amiable old gentleman in our compartment, seeing
him on the platform surrounded by a ring of dapper sycophants, who
laughed unreasonably at his mild jokes, began to exclaim, in great
wrath, "So many cabals! so many cabals! Unfortunate nation! there
is nothing but cabal and intrigue all the time. Those men have got
some sugar they want to dispose of to advantage, and so they fawn on
the Governor. It is dirty; it is foul," etc.</p>

<p>At Malaga there was a coast-guard steamer lying in the harbor, and,
as we were looking at it, I asked our companion, a resident, whether
they caught many smugglers.</p>

<p>"Oh, sometimes," was the answer. "Just enough to cover it."</p>

<p>"Cover what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the fraud. Out of twenty smuggling vessels they will take
perhaps one, to keep up appearances." And he made the usual significant
movement of the fingers denoting the acceptance of bribes.</p>

<p>The heat at Malaga surpassed anything we had encountered before.
The horses of the cabs had gay-colored awnings stretched over them
on little poles fixed to the shafts, so that when they moved along the
street they looked like holiday boats on four legs. The river that runs
through the city was completely dry, and, as if to complete the boat
similitude, the cabs drove wantonly across its bed instead of using the
bridges. These equipages, however, are commonplace compared with
the wagons used for the transportation of oil and water jars (<i>tinajas</i>) in
the adjoining province of Murcia. A delightful coolness was diffused
from the sea at evening, when the fashionable drive&mdash;the half-moon
mole stretching out to the light-house&mdash;was crowded with stylish vehicles,
and the sea-wall all along the street was lined with citizens, soldiers,
priests, and pretty women, who dangled their feet from the low
parapet in blissful indolence. Then, too, the lamps were lighted in the
floating bath-houses moored in the harbor, and one of them close to
the mouth of a city drain seemed to be particularly well patronized.
The streets, almost forsaken by day, were crowded after nightfall. The
shops were open late. By eight or nine o'clock life began.</p>

<p>The Café de la Loba (the Wolf)&mdash;an immense building, where
there is a court entirely roofed over by a single grape-vine, spreading<a name="page_160" id="page_160"></a>
from a stem fifteen inches in diameter, and rivalling the famous vines
of Hampton Court and Windsor&mdash;was well filled, and in many small
<i>tiendas de vino</i> heavy drinking seemed to be going on. But the Malaguenese
do not imbibe the rich sweet wines manufactured in their
vicinity. These are too heating to be taken in such a climate, as we
were able to convince ourselves on tasting some fine vintages at one
of the <i>bodegas</i> the next day. Nevertheless, the lower class of the inhabitants
find no difficulty in attaining to a maximum of drunkenness
on milder beverages. Even the respectable idlers in the café under
our hotel drank a great deal too much beer, if I may judge from
their prolonging their obstreperous discussion of politics into the small
hours, while we lay feverish in a room above listening to their voices,
blended with the whistle of a boatswain on some ship at the neighboring
quay; ourselves meanwhile enduring with Anglo-Saxon reserve
the too effusive attentions offered by mosquitoes of the Latin race.</p>

<p>In justice to the Spaniards it should be said that excessive drinking
is a rare fault among them. As a nation they surpass all other civilized
peoples in setting an example of temperance as to potations (excepting<a name="page_161" id="page_161"></a>
water), and of remarkable frugality in eating. The Mediterranean
ports, through their commerce with the outside world, are tinged by
foreign elements; license creeps in with notions of liberty; the sailors,
and that whilom powerful fraternity the smugglers, have likewise assisted
in fostering turbulent characteristics.</p>

<p>To me the best part of Malaga was the view of it from the deck of
a Segovia steamer, on the eve of a cruise along the coast. Behind the
plain sandy-colored houses rose a background of mountains fantastic
in outline as flames; the cathedral, in no way striking, towered up
above the roofs, and was in turn
overshadowed by an ancient fortress
on the eastern height, which
was one of the last to fall before
the returning tide of Spanish
arms, and still claws the precipitous
ridge with innumerable
towers and bastions, as if to keep
from slipping off its honorable
eminence in the drowsy lapses
of old age. Below this, close to
the water, stood the inevitable
Plaza de Toros&mdash;an immense
cheese-shaped structure of stone,
where a friend of mine, Spanish
by birth, tells me he was once
watching the game of bulls, when
part of the crowd were struck by
the happy thought of starting a
revolution. They acted at once
on this bright idea; they "pronounced"
in favor of something,
and attacked the military guard.
In an instant a battle had begun;
the place resounded with musketry,
and the populace tore away
pieces of the masonry to hurl at
the troops below. But that was
in the good old days, and such things do not happen now, though
there is always a strong detachment of soldiers on hand at the arena,
ready for any sudden revival of these freaks. The water around us<a name="page_162" id="page_162"></a>
shone with a lustre like satin; and, fluttering over the bright green surface,
played incredibly vivid reflections of blue and red from the steamers;
while the pure white light, striking back from the edges of the
undulations, quivered and shimmered along the black hulk of a vessel,
and looked like steam or mist in constant motion.</p>

<p>Highly effective, too, was the carbineer (all custom-house officers
in Spain, whether armed or not, are called <i>carabineros</i>) who stood on
deck with a musket at rest, a living monument to the majesty of the
revenue laws. We had been solemnly warned beforehand of the risk
we ran in carrying a basket of ale on board in the face of this functionary,
and the importance of giving him a <i>peseta</i> (twenty cents) had been
urged upon us; but we at first looked for him in vain, and when we
found him he appeared so harmless that we kept the <i>peseta</i>. I noticed
that he laid his gun aside as much as possible. Part of the time
he smoked a short pipe under cover of his huge mustache, and eyed
people sternly, as if suspecting that they might take advantage of this
temporary relaxing of vigilance; but he studiously avoided seeing any
merchandise of any description.</p>

<p>The steamer was to start at four in the afternoon, and we made
great haste to get on board in time; but there had evidently never
been the smallest intention of despatching her until an hour and a half
later. This was in accord with the national trait of distrust. No one
was expected to believe the announcement as to the time, and if the
real hour had been named, no one <i>would</i> have believed it. Aware of
this, the more experienced natives did not even begin to come aboard
until toward five o'clock. Spanish clocks are the most accommodating
kind of mechanism I have ever had the fortune to encounter. They
appear to exist rather as an ornamental feature than as articles of use.
You order a carriage, and it is promised at a certain time; you are told
that something is to be accomplished at a fixed hour; but this is only
done out of deference to your outlandish prejudices. The hour strikes,
and the thing is not done. You begin to doubt whether the hour
itself has arrived. Is it not a vulgar illusion to suppose so? Your
Spaniard certainly thinks it is. He knows that time is an arbitrary
distinction, and prefers to adopt the scale of eternity. The one exception
is the bull-fight. That is recognized as a purely mundane and
temporal institution; it must not be delayed a moment; and to make
sure of punctuality, it is begun almost before the time announced. But
anything like a sea-voyage, though it be only along the shore, comes
under a different heading, and must be undertaken with as much<a name="page_163" id="page_163"></a>
mystery and caution as if it were a conspiracy to erect a new government.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, we were glad to get away from the tyranny of the
minute-hand, and were not displeased at the lazy freedom of the steamer.
The stewards came up and shut the skylights, spread a table-cloth
over them, laid plates, and formed a hollow square of fruits and olives
in the centre. Those of the passengers that listed took their places at
this improvised banqueting board, and by the time the <i>puchero</i> was
served&mdash;a savory stew composed of chopped meat, beans, carrots, spices,
and any little thing the cook's fancy may suggest&mdash;we were moving out
of the basin, past the curved mole and the light-house, and toy battery
at its end. The sunset had thrown its glow over sky and mountains,
as if it were an after-thought, to make the surroundings perfect.
We glided smoothly over a floor of blue&mdash;deep, solid-looking, and veined
with white&mdash;a pale golden dome above us, and a delicious wind playing
round us, like the exhalation of some balmy sub-tropical dream. On
these coast steamers one buys a ticket for the transport, and then pays
for what he eats. This rule reduced the company at our deck table to
a choice and pleasant circle, the head of which was Señor Segovia, one
of the owners of the line, a benignant, comfortable Spaniard&mdash;"an Andalusian
to the core," as he proudly said. We had, as usual, early
chocolate at six or seven; breakfast not so near eleven as to admit any
suspicion of subserviency to the base time-keeping clock; and dinner&mdash;a
second but ampler breakfast&mdash;between five and six. Some of the
first-cabin passengers brought their own provision, or purchased it at
the towns where we touched every day, and fed secretly in out-of-the-way
places. As for the second-class, consisting mainly of peasants
swathed in strange garments edged and spotted with fantastic color,
they were never seen to eat; but I think that privately they gnawed
the pride of ancient race in their hearts, and found it sufficient provender.
We would come upon them, when we went forward in our night
patrol, lying on the deck in magnificent unconcern, enveloped by stately
rags wound round and round their bodies, and lifting toward us a
stern, reproachful gaze at our interruption of their tranquillity.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean was calm as a pond, and we roused ourselves to
a serene morning, under which the hills gleamed pale and clear along
the margin of the waves, the huge sides seamed with dry water-courses,
like the creases in a human palm. Beyond the first line of peaks we
could descry for a while the soft ghostly whiteness of an inland snow
range glimmering above the faded green, the violet shadows, the hard<a name="page_164" id="page_164"></a>
streaks of white and powderings of red earth in the lower series. No
sign of life was seen upon the puckered, savage coast. It was the bulwark
of that Tarshish to which Solomon sent his ships for gold; new to
us as it was new to him, yet now unutterably old; silent, yet speaking;
uncommunicative, yet vaguely
predicting a future vast and unknown
as the vanished ages. It
would be hard to tell how awful
in its unchanged grandeur
was the face of those mighty
hills, so unexpectedly eloquent.</p>

<p>It was a relief to find that
we were approaching Almeria.
A road cut in the rock; a stout
arched bridge carrying it over
an indentation of the sea; a
small square edifice on a rock
to guard the road; then the
distant jumble of low houses
along a sheltered bay, and an
empty fortress on the sharp hillcrest
over it&mdash;these were the
tokens of our progress toward
another inhabited spot. We
had on board a two-legged enigma
in a white helmet-hat, who
wrote with ostentatious industry
in a note-book, played fluently
on the cabin piano, and
now emerged upon the quarterdeck
in a pair of bulging canary
leather slippers which gave his
feet the appearance of overgrown
lemons. He afterward proved to be an English colporteur. We
also had a handsome, gay, talkative, and witty Frenchman, who, with
a morbid conscientiousness as to what was fitting, insisted on being
sea-sick, although the sea was hardly ruffled; and him we succeeded in
resuscitating, after the boat had come quietly to anchor in the harbor,
so far that he began to long audibly for Paris and the café on the
boulevard, "<i>et mon absinthe</i>." We watched with these companions the<a name="page_165" id="page_165"></a>
naked boys who surrounded the vessel in a flotilla of row-boats, offering
to dive for coppers thrown into the water, precisely as I have seen
young Mexican Indians do at Acapulco. Near by lay another steamer
just in from Africa, disembarking a mass of returned Spanish settlers,
fugitives from the atrocities of the Arabs at Oran: a pathetic sight
as they dropped silently into the barges that bore them to shore&mdash;some
utterly destitute, with only the clothes in which they had fled
before the fanatic murderers, and others accompanied by a few meagre
household goods. Did they feel that "irremediable nostalgia," I wonder,
of which Señor Castelar speaks? The sun was as hot as that which
had shone upon them just across the strait, on the edge of the Dark
Continent; and the low-roofed glaring houses huddled at the feet of the
Moorish stronghold, the Alcasaba, were so Oriental that I should think
they must have found it hard to believe they had left Africa at all.</p>

<p>Almeria, like other towns of this southern shore-line, is more Eastern
than Spanish in appearance&mdash;only the long winding or zigzag covered
ways, traced on the steep hills like swollen veins, indicated the
presence of the lead-mines which give it an existence in commerce.
These conduct the poisonous smoke to a point above the air inhaled
by the townsfolk, and it is seen puffing from tall chimneys at the crest
of the steep, as if the mountain were alive and gasping for breath. The
town, faintly relieved against its pale, dusty background as we first saw
it, almost disappeared in the blinding blaze of light that swept it when
we got closer. We landed, and attempted to walk, but the dry, burning
heat made us shrink for shelter into any narrow thread of shadow
that the houses presented. Even the shadows looked whitish. It was
impossible to get as far as the weed-grown cathedral, which, as we
could see from the water, had been provided in former times with fortified
turrets for defence against piratical incursions. So we sunk gratefully
into a restaurant kiosk at the head of the <i>alameda</i>, where we could
look down the hot, yellow street to a square of cerulean sea; and there
we sipped lemonade while tattered, crimson-sashed peasants moved about
us, some of them occasionally dashing the road with water dipped from
a gutter-rivulet at the side. We had barely become reconciled to the
Granadan women in trousers, when we were obliged to notice that the
men in this vicinity wore short white skirts in place of the usual nether
garment. How is Spain ever to be unified on such a basis as this?
The local patriots had seemingly wrestled with the problem and been
defeated, for a dreary memorial column in front of the kiosk recorded
how they had fallen in some futile revolutionary struggle.<a name="page_166" id="page_166"></a></p>

<p>On a promontory, passed as we sailed away, the drought and dust
of the town yielded suddenly to luxurious greenness of sugar-cane and
other growths. Almeria was once surrounded by similar fertility, but
the land has been so wastefully denuded of forest that all through this
region&mdash;the old kingdoms of Murcia and Valencia&mdash;only certain favorable
spots retain their earlier plenty by means of constant care and
assiduous watering. Cartagena, one of the chief naval stations of the
country, cannot exhibit even such an oasis. It is unmitigated desert.
Not a tree or shrub shows itself amid the baked and calcined stone-work
and blistering pavements of the city; and the landscape without
looks almost as arid. The place is considered impregnable to a foreign
foe, and I can't imagine that foe wanting it to be otherwise, if conquest
involves residence. Entered by a narrow gap commanded by batteries,
the harbor is a round and spacious one, scooped out of frowning highlands
that bear on the apex of their cones unattainable forts, thrown
up like the rim around volcanic craters. There is but one level access
to the city on the land side, and that is blockaded by a stout wall with
a single gate. Such was our next goal, reached after a quiet night,
which Velveteen and I spent in the open air, having carried our rugs
and pillows up from the state-room on its invasion by new passengers.
At two o'clock in the morning our vessel stole into the port. There
was one pale amber streak in the east, over the gloomy, indistinct
heights studded with embrasured walls and mine chimneys. By-and-by
a brightness grew out of it. Then the amber was reflected in the
glassy harbor. An arch of rose cloud sprung up after this, and was
also reflected, the hills lightening to a faded gray and brown. All this
time the stars continued sparkling, and one of them threw rings of
dancing diamond on the broken wave. Suddenly the diamond flash
and the rose tint vanished, and it was broad golden-white day, with
calorific beams beating strongly upon us, instead of the crepuscular
chill of dawn that had just been searching our veins.</p>

<p>
Cartagena has its war history, of course. A Commune was established
there by Roque Barcia in 1873, which declined allegiance to the
republican government at Madrid, and the city was accordingly besieged.
Barcia had been living on forced loans from the inhabitants,
and was loath to go; but the army of the republic made a few dents
in the stone wall with twenty-pounders, and that decided him. He
got on board the Spanish navy in the harbor, and ran away with it to
Africa. Perhaps that accounts for the slimness of the naval contingent
now. There is an academy for cadets in the place, but only two<a name="page_167" id="page_167"></a>
small ships-of-war were anchored in the noble bay. The town of Cartagena
is remarkable for big men and very minute donkeys. The men
ride on the donkeys with incredible hardihood. You see a burly Sancho
Panza flying along the main street at a rapid pace, with his sandalled
feet some three inches from the ground, and wonder what new kind
of motor he has discovered, until you perceive beneath his ponderous
body a nervous, vaguely ecstatic quivering of four black legs, attached
to a small spot of head from
which two mulish ears project.

<p>
There is not much to see in
Cartagena. Blind people seem
to be numerous there&mdash;a fact
which may be owing to the excessive
dazzle of the sunlight
and absence of verdure. But I
couldn't help thinking some of
them must have gone blind from
sheer <i>ennui</i>, because there was
nothing around them worth
looking at. Our visit, however,
was in one respect a success:
we found a broad strip of shade
there. It was caused by the
high city wall intercepting the
forenoon light. Out of the
shadow some enterprising men
had constructed, with the aid of
two or three chairs and several
pairs of shears, a barber's shop
<i>al fresco</i>; and asses and peasants,
as they travelled in and
out through the city gate, stopped
at this establishment to
be shaved. For it is an important
item in the care of Spanish donkeys that they should be
sheared as to the back, in order to make a smoother resting-place for
man or pannier. So while the master held his animal one of the barbers
plied some enormous clacking shears, and littered the ground with
mouse-colored hair, leaving the beast's belly fur-covered below a fixed
line, and for a small additional price executing a raised pattern of starpoints<a name="page_168" id="page_168"></a>
around the neck. The tonsorial profession is an indispensable
one in a country where shaving the whole face is so generally practised
among all the humbler orders, not to mention <i>toreros</i> and ecclesiastics;
but the discomfort to which the barber's customers submit
is astonishing. Instead of being pampered, soothed, labored at with
confidential respectfulness, and lulled into luxurious harmony with himself,
as happens in America, a man who courts the razor in Spain has to
sit upright in a stiff chair, and meekly hold under his chin a brass basin
full of suds, and fitting his throat by means of a curved nick at one
side. One individual we saw seated by the dusty road at the gate,
with a towel around his shoulders and another in his hands to catch<a name="page_169" id="page_169"></a>
his own falling locks. He looked submissive and miserable, as if assisting
at his own degradation, while the barber was magnified into a
tyrant exercising sovereign pleasure, and might have been expected,
should the whim cross him, to strike off his victim's head instead of
his hair.

<p>The voyage continued as charmingly as it began. Quiet transitions
from the deep blue outside to the pronounced green within the harbors
were its most startling incidents. The colporteur gave tracts to the
sailors, or traded Bibles for melons with the fruit boys; the Frenchman,<a name="page_170" id="page_170"></a>
who was making a commercial tour through the provinces, bestowed
a liberal and cheerful disparagement on the nation which afforded
him a business. We continued to eat meals in holiday fashion
on the skylight hatches, and slept there through the balmy night, occasionally
seeing the sailors clambering on the taffrail or in the rigging,
always with cigarettes, the glowing points of which shone in the darkness
like fire-flies. The gravity with which they stuck to these <i>papelitos</i>
while knotting ropes or lowering a boat was fascinating in its inappropriateness.
The headlands grew less bold before we tied to the dock
at Alicante in the hush of a sultry night. We could see nothing of
the town except a bright twinkle of lamps along the quay, contrasting
gayly with the blood-red light on a felucca in the harbor, its long vivid
stain trickling away through the water like the current from a wound;
and the rules of the customs would not admit of our landing till
morning.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>O<small>UR</small> trunks had been on the dock two or three hours when we debarked
in a small boat, and some fifteen men had gathered around
them, waiting for the owners, like sharks attracted by floating fragments
from a ship and wondering what manner of prey is coming to
them. They all touched their caps to us as we bumped the shore.
These cap-touches are worth in the abstract about one real&mdash;five cents.
The grand total of speculative politeness laid out upon us was therefore
more than half a dollar; but, on our selecting two porters, values
rapidly declined, and the market "closed in a depressed condition."
The customs officers wore a wild, freebooters' sort of uniform&mdash;blue
trousers with a red stripe, blue jeans blouses with a belt and long
sword, and straw hats. They were also very lazy; and while we were
awaiting their attentions we had time to observe the manner of unloading
merchandise in these latitudes. Every box, barrel, or bale
hoisted out of a lighter was swung by a rope to which twenty men
lent their strength; there were three more men in the lighter, and
three others arranged the hoisting tackle; in all, twenty-six persons
were occupied with a task for which two or three ought to suffice.
Each time, the crowd of haulers fastened on the cable, ran off frantically
with it, and then, in a simultaneous fit of paralysis, dropped it as
the burden was landed.</p>

<p>
These laborers wore huge straw hats, on the crown of which was<a name="page_171" id="page_171"></a>
fitted a <i>birreta</i>, the small ordinary blue cap of the country. They had
a queer air of carrying this superfluous cap around on top of the head
as a sort of solemn ceremony. The wharf was alive, too, with small
wagons, roofed over by a cover
of heavy matting made of <i>esparto</i>
grass, and furnished with a long,
rough-barked pole at the side, to
be used as a brake. Above this
busy scene towered a luminous
sienna-tinted cliff, sustaining the
castle of Santa Barbara poised in
the white air like a dream-edifice;
though a rift high up in the hill
marks the spot where the French
exploded a mine during the Peninsular
war. All these Mediterranean
towns are guarded by
some such eagle's eyry overlooking
the sea, and the old monarchs
showed a fine poetic sense
in granting them for municipal
arms their local castle resting on
a wave. Close to the lapping
waters lay the serried houses,
bordered by an esplanade planted
with rows of short palms.
When the carbineers had looked
vaguely into our trunks, and shut
them again, the porters tossed
them into a little cart, and plunged into the town at a pace with
which we could compete only so far as to keep them in sight while
they twisted first around one corner and then another, and then up
a long chalky street to the Fonda Bossio, which has the name of being
the best hotel in Spain. It has excellent cookery, and some furlongs
of tile-floored corridor, which the servants apparently believe to
be streets, for they water them every day, just as the thoroughfares
are watered, out of tin basins. We were overwhelmed with courtesy.
For instance, I would call the waiter.

<p>The waiters and chamber-maids ate their meals at little tables in the
hall, and whenever I passed them, if they were eating, they made a
gracious gesture toward their <i>pillau</i> of rice. "Would your grace like
to eat?"</p>

<p>This offer to share their food with any one who goes by is a simple
and kindly inheritance from the East; but it becomes a little embarrassing,
and I longed for a pair of back stairs to slink away by, without
having to decline their hospitality every time I went out.</p>

<p>To go out in the middle of the day was like looking into the sun
itself. Everybody stayed in-doors behind thick curtains of matting,
and dozed or dripped away the time in idle perspiration; but hearing
unaccountable blasts of orchestral music during this forced retirement,
I inquired, and found them to proceed from the rehearsal of a Madrid
opera company then in Alicante. Our attendant at table proved to
be a duplex character&mdash;a serving-man by day and a fourteenth lord in
the chorus by night, with black and yellow stockings, and a number
of gestures indicating astonishment, indignation, or, in fact, anything
that the emergency required. We had the pleasure of seeing him on
the stage that very evening, and of listening to an extravagant performance
of "La Favorita," between two acts of which an usher came
in and collected the tickets of the whole audience. The theatre was
remarkably spacious for a town of thirty thousand inhabitants; but
Alicante is a favorite winter resort, and even maintains a "Gallistic
Circus;" that is, a place for cock-fights.</p>

<p>The Garden of Alicante is a luscious spot, hidden away some two
or three miles from the town, and owned by the Marques de Venalua,
a young man of large wealth, who spends all his time at Alicante, and
is a public benefactor, having introduced water in pipes at his own expense.
The carriage and consumption of water, indeed, seemed to be
the chief business of the population. They have a system of fountains
for distributing sea-water from which the salt has been extracted, and
women and children are kept going to these with huge jars, to satisfy
the local thirst. To be born thirsty, live thirsty, and die so, is a privilege
enjoyable only in countries like Southern Spain. One can form
there, too, a vivid idea of the desert, from the delight with which he
hails the green <i>Huerta</i>, or garden. The road and fields on the way
thither were like a waste of cinders and ashes. The almond and fig
trees, the pomegranates and algarrobas beside the way, were coated
with dust that lay upon them like thin snow; and the almond-nuts,
where they hung in sight, resembled plaster casts, so pervasive was the<a name="page_175" id="page_175"></a>
white deposit. But all at once we mounted a low rise, and the wide
stretch of verdant plantations lay before us, thick-foliaged, cool, sweet,
and refreshing, with villas embowered among the oranges and palms, a
screen of dim mountains beyond, and the silent blue sea brimming the
horizon on the right. It was a spectacle delicious as sleep to tired eyes;
it brought a cry of pleasure to my lips and grateful life to the heart.</p>

<p>But this spot, lovely as it is, becomes insignificant beside the glorious
Huerta of Valencia, stretching for more than thirty miles from the
olive-clad hills around Jativa to that city, which is the pleasantest in
Mediterranean Spain, and the most characteristic of all, after Toledo,
Granada, and Sevilla. There one travels through an unbroken tract
of superb cultivation&mdash;a garden in exact literalness, yet a territory in
size.</p>

<p>We took the rail from Alicante in the evening; but a mass of Oran
fugitives, escorted by a company of soldiers (for the most part drunk),
encumbered our train, and delayed its starting for an hour or two.
Then followed a slow, wearisome ride through the black night, with a<a name="page_176" id="page_176"></a>
change at the junction of La Encina about twelve o'clock, involving
much tribulation in the re-weighing and renewed registering of baggage;
after which we were stowed into a totally dark compartment of
the other train, and made to wait three hours longer. With the first<a name="page_177" id="page_177"></a>
rays of dawn our locomotive began to creep, and we fell into a doze,
from which I was awakened after a while by the loud irruption of
somebody into our carriage, accompanied by a jangle like that of
sleigh-bells. It turned out to be a peasant, who, in consequence of
the general over-crowding, had been ushered into the first-class carriage,
bringing with him a couple of children and some mule-harness
provided with bells. I was inclined to be indignant with him for his
disturbing intrusion; but, as it was now broad daylight, I began to
look out of the window, and soon had cause to consider the peasant
a benefactor; for we were just leaving Jativa, a most picturesque old
town, with a castle famous even in Roman times; the native place,
also, of the Borgias (Pope Calixtus III., and Rodrigro, the father of
Cæsar Borgia). Immediately afterward we entered the garden region.
Miles of carefully-tended growth, thousands of orchards linked
together in one series, acres upon acres of fields where every square
inch is made to yield abundantly&mdash;such is the Huerta of Valencia.
We passed endless orange-groves, each single tree in which had its
circle of banked earth to hold the water when let on from the canals
of tile that coursed everywhere like veins of silver, carrying life to the
harvests. Then came vast fields dotted with the yellow blossom of the
pea-nut, on low vine-like plants. Again, breadths of citron and lemon,
followed by extensive rice farms, where the cultivators stood dressing
the unripe plantations, up to their ankles in the water of a feathery
green swamp. Not a rood of earth is unimproved, excepting where
some thriving red-roofed village is hemmed in by the fragrant paradise.
In one place you will see, perhaps, a mouldering red tower like those of
the Alhambra, or a church spire lifted amid the trees, and, high above
the other greenery, clusters of date-palms leaning together, as if they
whispered among themselves of other days. Near by is the Lake of
Albufera, close to the sea and twenty-seven miles in circumference&mdash;nourished
both from the sea and from the river Turia, so that it becomes
an immense reservoir of fish and game. Its marshy edges once
offered shelter to numerous smugglers, and it is said that General Prim,
who was on good terms with them, found a hiding-place there while in
danger and before he came to power. No wonder that the Cid fought
gallantly to win this land from the infidel, and when he had gained it
sent for his wife and daughter from distant Burgos to come and see
the prize! Its fertility to-day, however, is due to the irrigation introduced
by the Moors, and since maintained. The same thing could be
done with the Tagus and Ebro rivers, but the Spaniard having had the<a name="page_178" id="page_178"></a>
example before him for only about six centuries, has not yet found
time to follow it. The water supply is so precious that proprietors are
allowed to use it for their own crops only on fixed days, and for so
many hours at a time. Disputes of course arise, but they are settled
by the Water Court&mdash;a tribunal without appeal, consisting of twelve
peasant proprietors, who meet once a week in Valencia; and I saw
them there holding their session in very primitive style, on a long
pink sofa set in an arched door-way of the cathedral.</p>

<p>Valencia was in the midst of its annual festival when we arrived;
a bright, gay, spirited, and busy town, more cheerful than ever just
then. There were to be three days of bull-fighting&mdash;"bulls to the
death!"&mdash;with eight taurian victims each day; the best swordsmen in
Spain; and horses and mules displaying gilded and silvered hoofs.
The theatres were perfumed. There were match games of <i>pelota</i>&mdash;rackets&mdash;the
national substitute
for cricket or base-ball; and a
week's fair was in progress on
the other side of the river
Turia, with bannered pavilions,
thousands of painted lanterns;
lotteries, concerts, and booth
shows, to which the admission
was "half price for children and
soldiers." Trade was brisk also
in the city; brisk in the Mercado,
that quaint business street crowded with little stalls, and with
peasants in blue, red, yellow, mantled and cothurned, their heads topped
with pointed hats or wrapped with variegated handkerchiefs deftly
knotted into a high crown; brisk, likewise, in those peculiar shops behind
the antique Silk Exchange, which are named from the signs they
hang out, representing the Blessed Virgin, Christ, John the Baptist, or
the Bleeding Heart. One had for its device a rose, and another, distinguished
by two large toy lambs placed at its door, was known without
other distinction as the Lamb of God. But in the more modern
quarter the shop-keepers ventured on a Parisian brilliancy which we
did not encounter anywhere else. Their arrangement of wares was
prettily effective, and the fashion prevailed of having curtains for the
show-windows painted with figures in modern dress, done in exceedingly
clever, artistic style, well drawn, full of humor and fine realistic characterization.<a name="page_179" id="page_179"></a></p>

<p>Altogether, Valencia is the cheeriest of Spanish cities, unless one
excepts Barcelona, which is half French, and in its present estate wholly
modern. Moreover, Valencia abounds in racy and local traits, both
of architecture and humanity. The Street of the Cavaliers is lined
with sombre, strange, shabbily elegant old mansions of the nobility,
with Gothic windows and open arcades in the top story; the new
houses are gayly tinted in blue and rose and cream-color; and the
gourd-like domes of the cathedral and other large buildings glisten with
blue tiles and white, set in stripes. You find yourself continually, as
you come from various quarters, bringing up in sight of the octagonal
tower of Santa Catalina, strangely suggestive of a pagoda, without in
the least being one. The Silk Exchange, from which the shining web
that wealth is woven out of has long since vanished, contains one of
the most beautiful of existing Gothic halls under a roof sustained by
fluted and twisted pillars, themselves light as knotted skeins; while
from the outer cornice grotesque shapes peer out over the life of to-day;
a grinning monk, an imp playing a guitar, a crumbling buzzard,
serving as gargoyles. Just opposite is the market, where you may buy
enormous bunches of luscious white grapes for a penny, or pry into
second-hand shops rich in those brilliant mantles with the "cat" fringe
of balls, for which the town is as noted as for its export of oranges.
The old battlemented walls of the city, it is true, have been torn down:
it was done simply to give employment to the poor a few years since.
But there are some fine old gates remaining&mdash;those of Serranos and
Del Cuarte. We drove out of one and came in by the other, about
half a mile away&mdash;a diversion that brought us under a rigid examination
from the customs guard, which levies a tax on every basket of
produce brought in from the country, and was inclined to regard us
as a dutiable importation.</p>

<span class="caption">BARCELONA FISHERMEN.</span>
</p>

<p>One may go quite freely to the port, however&mdash;the Grao&mdash;which is
two miles distant. A broad boulevard hedged with sycamores leads
thither, which in summer is crowded by <i>tartanas</i>&mdash;bouncing little covered
wagons lined with crimson curtains, and usually carrying a load
of pretty señoritas&mdash;and by more imposing equipages adorned with
footmen in the English style. Everybody goes to the shore to bathe
toward evening, for Valencia is the Brighton of the Madrileños. The
little bathing establishments extend for a long distance on the sands,
and are very neat. Each has its fanciful name, as "The Pearl," or
"The Madrid Girl," and the proprietors stand in front vociferously soliciting
your custom. Between these and the water are refreshment<a name="page_180" id="page_180"></a>
sheds with tables, and every one eats or drinks on coming out of the
sea. Farther down the shore the women have their own houses, and
a fence of reeds protects them from intrusion while they are running
to or from the surf; but it is my duty to record that the men formed
a line at this fence, and systematically gazed through the breaks in it,
which was the more embarrassing, perhaps, because the fair Valencians
bathe in very plain, baggy, and ugly gowns. On the streets or in the
Glorieta Garden, and in their proper habiliments, they are the noblest
looking and most beautiful of Spanish women, often possessing flaxen
hair and dark-blue eyes which recall a Gothic ancestry, together
with something simple and regular about the features that is perhaps
due to the ancient Greek colonization. At still another part of the
beach horses were allowed to go into the waves; and this was a sight
also eminently Greek in its suggestion. Naked boys bestrode the animals,
and urged them forward into the spray-fringed tide. The arched
necks, the prancing movement of the horses, the sportive shock of foam
against their broad chests, and the pressing knees of the nude riders<a name="page_181" id="page_181"></a>
in full play of muscle to keep their seats, were like a breathing and
stirring relief on some temple frieze, clear-cut in the pure and sparkling
sunlight. There was once a Valencian school of painters, but we saw
nothing of this in their work. The museum offers what our newspapers
would call a "carnival" of rubbish, but it also contains some striking,
shadowy, startlingly lighted canvases of Ribalta&mdash;saints and martyrs
and ascetics vividly but not joyously portrayed; a few wonderful portraits
by Goya, fresh as if only just completed; and one of Velasquez's
three portraits of himself.</p>

<p>From Valencia to Barcelona the valleys along the coast are fertile.
Vineyards, spreading their long files of green over a warm red soil that
seems tinged with the blood of the grape, vie with the olive in that
picturesque, productive belt between the hills and the blue, swelling
sweep of the Mediterranean. Here is Murviedro, the old Saguntum,
once the scene of a fierce siege and horrible sufferings, now basking
quietly in the hot light&mdash;a time-worn, sun-tanned, beggared old city,
which is not ashamed to make a show of its decayed Roman theatre;
and farther on Tarragona, which professes to have had at one time a
million inhabitants, and is now a little wine-producing town. Churches
and castles, rich in delicate workmanship and all manner of historic
association, crop up everywhere. The very shards in the fields, you
fancy, may suddenly unfold something of that full and varied past
which was once as real as to-day's meridian glow. Yet at any moment
you may lose sight of all this in the brilliant, stimulating, yet softly
modified beauty of the landscape's colors, and your whole mind is absorbed
by the vague neutral hues of a treeless hill-side, or the rich,
positive blue of the sea, in which the white sail of a <i>chalupa</i> seems to
be inlaid like a bit of ivory.</p>

<p>All the while, as you go northward, Spain&mdash;the real Spain&mdash;is slipping
from you. The palms disappear as if a noiseless earthquake had
swallowed them up; even the olive becomes less frequent, and by-and-by
you are in piny Catalonia. You reach Barcelona, the greatest commercial
city of the kingdom, and you find it the boast of the citizens
that they are not Spaniards. They are Spanish mainly in their love
of revolt. So prompt are they to join in every uprising, that the garrison
quartered there has to be kept as high as ten thousand men; but
for the most part it is rather a French maritime dépot than a thing of
ancient or peculiar Spain. There is a large and artificial park on one
side, and the fort of Monjuich on the other, and a lot of shipping in
the harbor; and a glorious embowered avenue, called the Rambla,<a name="page_182" id="page_182"></a>
where pale-faced, long-lashed, coquettishly smiling women walk in great
numbers, carrying out the usual national custom of a peripatetic reception
and conversation party. It was the feast of Santiago when we
came&mdash;it is always a feast of something everywhere in that pious country&mdash;and
the theatres were doing a great business with trifling plays
and charming ballets. Barcelona is not only the industrious city, it is
also the cultivated one of the Peninsula. The opera there is one of
the best in the world, and was once carried off bodily to Madrid by an
ardent manager, who for his pains received the scorn of the envious
Madrid people: they would not come to his performances, and he was
almost ruined in consequence.</p>

<p>The old cathedral of the city is a temple singularly impressive by
simple means&mdash;a sober Spanish-Gothic structure bathed in a perpetual
gloom, through which the stained windows show with a jewelled splendor
almost supernatural. The weirdness of the interior effect is farther
intensified by the dark pit of Santa Eulalia's shrine opening under
the altar, and set with a row of burning lamps, on which the darkness
seems to hang like a cloak depending from a chain of gold. The invariable
rule in Spanish cathedrals is that the choir should be placed
in the central nave, like that at Westminster Abbey, and elaborated
into a complete enclosure by itself&mdash;which, although it interferes with
the total effect of the interior, is frequently very striking in its lavish
agglomeration of carved wood and stone, metal railings, gilding, and
similar details. It was in the peculiarly picturesque choir of this cathedral
of Santa Eulalia that the order of the Golden Fleece was once
convened by Charles V., and the panels over the stalls are blazoned
with the bearings of the various nations and nobles represented in that
body. Being discovered only after one has grown accustomed to the
dark, these fading glories of heraldry steal gradually upon the eye, as
if through the obscuring night of time. I found the ancient cloister,
without, on the south-west side, a delightful, shadowy, suggestive place:
there, too, may be seen a fountain surmounted by a small equestrian
statue of St. George, which reminds one of a fabulous story in Münchausen;
for the tail of the horse is formed by a jet of water flowing
out of the body at the rear. Inside the church again hangs, under the
organ-loft, an enormous wooden and painted Saracen's head&mdash;a species
of relic not uncommon, I believe, in Catalonian temples. It may be
added here that the custom of the "historical giants" at Corpus Christi
is maintained in Barcelona as we had seen it at Burgos, and those effigies
are stowed away somewhere in the sacred precincts. There is a<a name="page_183" id="page_183"></a>
curious mingling of the naïve and the sophisticated in the fact that
some of the giants, wearing female attire, have new dresses for each
year, and thereby set the fashions for the ensuing twelvemonth for all
the womankind of the city. And however advanced the urban society
may be, with its trade, its opera, its books, gilded cafés and superb clubs,
the spirit of progress does not spread very far into the country. When
a piece of railroad was built, not very long ago, opening up a new rural
section in the neighborhood, the peasants watched the advance of the
locomotive along the rails with profound interest. Finally, one old
man asked, "But where is the <i>mule</i> kept?&mdash;inside?"</p>

<p>He was willing to admit that the engine worked finely, but no
power could convince him that it was possible for it to go by other
impulsion than that of a mule's legs.</p>

<p>Another relic of by-gone times is the cap universally worn in this
region by the longshoremen, the fishers, and the male portion of the
lower orders generally; for it is nothing less than the old Phrygian
liberty cap, imported hither by the Paul Pry Ph&oelig;nicians ages ago.
Woven in a single piece, it appears at first sight to be a long, soft,
commodious bag, tinted with vermilion or violet or brown as the case
may be. Into the aperture the native inserts his head and then pulls
the rest of the flapping contrivance down as far as he pleases, letting
the end float loose in the wind, or more commonly bringing it round
to the front, curling it over and tucking it in upon itself in such a way
as to make an overhanging protection for the eyes, and to give the
whole a look that recalls the top of an Oxford student's cap. With
this head-gear, and wearing sandals made of fine hempen cord tied by
long black tapes, the men presented a free, half barbarous and sufficiently
picturesque appearance. I don't know how long we might have
continued to roam the streets of Barcelona, listening to the uncouth
<i>patois</i> of the locality, in which French and Spanish words are so outlandishly
mingled, nor how long we should have clung to the remnants
of architecture and history that jutted seductively above the surface
of the modern here and there, if it had not been that cold necessity
limited our time and propelled us relentlessly northward. Even now
I find that my pen is reluctant to leave the tracing of those vanished
scenes, and hesitates to write the last word as much as if it were an
enchanter's wand, instead of a plain, business-like little instrument.</p>

<p>With its usual fatuity the railroad obliged us to start so early that
at the first dusky gray streak of dawn we were dismally taking our
coffee in the <i>patio</i> of the hotel. The <i>dueño</i> was sleeping by sections<a name="page_184" id="page_184"></a>
on two hard chairs, considerately screened from us by a clump of
orange shrubs, and murmuring now and then some direction to the
half-invisible waiter floating about in a dark arcade; but he roused
himself, and woke up wholly for a minute or two while perpetrating
a final extortion. Otherwise the silence was profound. It was the
silence of the past, the unseen current of oblivion that sets in and begins
to eddy round the facts of to-day, in such a country, the moment
human activity is suspended or the reality of the present is at all
dimmed. Silence here leads at once to retrospection; differing in this
from the mute solitude of American places, which somehow always
tingles with anticipation. And the <i>dueño</i>, in overcharging us, became
only the type of a long line of historic plunderers that have infested
the Peninsula from the date of the Roman rule down to the incursion
of Napoleon and the most recent period. His little game was invested
with all the dignity of history and tradition. The sickly light of
day above the court struggled feebly and dividedly with the waning
yellow of the candle-flame on our table.</p>

<p>"After all," said Velveteen, "I'm glad to be going, for this is no
longer Spain."</p>

<p>And yet, at the instant of leaving, we discovered that it was indeed
Spain, and a pang of regret followed those words.</p>

<p>As we issued from the hotel we saw, crossing the street in the increased
dawn-light, and striding toward the dépot, the two Civil Guards.
It looked as if we should be captured on the very threshold of liberty.
The thought lent wings to our haste.... Some hours afterward, when
we were passing through the tunnels of the Pyrenees, we congratulated
ourselves on our escape; and, indeed, as we looked back to the mountain-wall
from France, we could fancy we saw two specks on the summit
which might have been our pursuers. They were too late! Their
own excess of mystery had baffled them. They had dogged us every
league of the way, and yet we had traversed Spain without being detected
as&mdash;what? I really don't know, but I'm sure those Civil Guards
must. If not, their military glare, their guns, and their secrecy are the
merest mockeries.</p>

<p>How softly the waves broke along the Mediterranean sands that
morning, close to the rails over which we were flying! Green and
white, or violet, and shimmered over by the crimson splendor of the
illumined East, they surged one after another upon the golden shore
and spent themselves like wasted treasure. There was something
mournful in their movement&mdash;something very sad in the presence of<a name="page_185" id="page_185"></a>
this beauty which I was never to see again. Did I not hear mingled
with the sparkling flash and murmur of those waves a long-drawn
"<i>A-a-ay!</i>"&mdash;the most pathetic of Spanish syllables, which had thrown
its shadow across the fervid little songs heard so often by the way?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bird, little bird that wheelest<br /></span>
<span class="ist">Through God's fair worlds in the sky"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="nind">the strain came back again, with the memory of a low-tuned guitar;
and the waves went on, arriving and departing; and the land of our
pilgrimage steadily receded. The waves are breaking yet on that windless
coast; but, for us, Spain&mdash;brilliant, tawny, bright-vestured Spain,
with all its ruins and poetry, its desolation and beauty and gaudy
semi-barbarism&mdash;has been rapt away once more into the atmosphere
of distance and of dreams!</p>

a country to reach, nor so inconvenient
to travel in after one
has got there, as is generally
supposed. Doubtless the obstacles
which it presented to the
tourist until within a few years
were great; and much that is
disagreeable still remains to vex
those who are accustomed to
the smoother ways, and carefully-oiled
machinery for travel, of
regions more civilized. But the
establishment of a system of
railroads, describing an outline
that passes through nearly all
the places which it is desirable
to visit, has supplied a means of
transit sufficient, safe, and passably
comfortable. The other
disadvantages formerly opposed to the inquiring stranger are likewise
in process of diminution. In order to make clear the exact state of
things likely to be encountered by those who, having followed the
present writer in his account of a rapid journey, may determine to
take a similar direction themselves, this chapter of suggestion is added,
which it is hoped will have value in the way of a practical equipment
for the voyage.</p>

<p><i>Patience</i>.&mdash;The first requisite, it should be said, in one about to visit
Spain, is a reasonable amount of good-humored patience, with which
to meet discomforts and provoking delays. The customs of that country
are not to be reversed by fuming at them; anger will not aid the<a name="page_187" id="page_187"></a>
digestion which finds itself annoyed by a peculiar cookery; and no
amount of irritation will suffice to make Spanish officials and keepers
of hostelries one whit more obliging than they are at present&mdash;their
regard for the convenience of the public being just about equal to that
of the average American hotel clerk or railroad employé.</p>

<p><i>Passports</i>.&mdash;Next to patience may be placed a passport; though it
differs from the former article in being of no particular use. I observe
that guide-books lay stress upon the passport as something very important;
and, no doubt, it is gratifying to possess one. There is a
subtle flattery in the personal relation, approaching familiarity, which
an instrument of this kind seems to set up on the part of government
toward the individual; there is a charming unreality, moreover, in the
description it gives of your personal appearance and the color of your
eyes, making you feel, when you read it, as if you were a character in
fiction. Following the rules, I procured a passport and put it into a
stout envelope, ready for much use and constant wear; but all that it
accomplished for me was to add a few ounces of weight to my <i>impedimenta</i>.
No one ever asked for it, and I doubt whether the military
police would have understood what it was, had they seen it. My
experience on first crossing the frontier taught me never to volunteer
useless information. Our trunks had been passed after a mere opening
of the lids and lifting of the trays, and an officer was listlessly examining
the contents of my shoulder-bag. Thinking that he was troubled
by the enigmatic nature of a few harmless opened letters which it
contained, I said, re-assuringly, as he was dropping them back into their
place, "They are only letters."</p>

<p>"Letters!" he repeated, with rekindled vigilance. And, taking up
the sheets again, of which he could not understand a word, he squandered
several minutes in gazing at them in an absurd pretence of profundity.</p>

<p>If I had insisted on unfurling my country's passport, I should
probably have been taken into custody at once, as a person innocent
enough to deserve thorough investigation. Nevertheless, a passport
may be a good thing to hold in reserve for possible contingencies. It
is said also to be of use, now and then, in securing admission to galleries
and museums on days or at hours when they are generally closed
to the public; but of this I cannot speak from experience.</p>

<p><i>Custom-house</i>.&mdash;We had no great difficulty with examinations by
custom-house officers, except at Barcelona, where we arrived about one
o'clock in the morning and had to undergo a scene excessively annoying<a name="page_188" id="page_188"></a>
at the time, but comical enough in the retrospect. Being desirous
to embark on the hotel omnibus in search of quarters, we hastened to
the baggage-room to claim our trunks by the registry receipt given us
at Valencia; but the "carbineer" explained that we could not have
them just then. After waiting a little, we took out keys and politely
proposed to open them for examination. This, also, he declined. I
then offered him a cigar, which he accepted in a very gracious way,
giving it a slight flourish and shake in his hand (after the usual manner),
to indicate his appreciation of the courtesy; but still he made no
motion to accommodate us in the matter we had most at heart. Some
agreeable young Scotchmen, who had joined our party, urged me to
make farther demonstrations, and I conferred with the omnibus-driver,
who explained that we must wait for some other parcels to be collected
from the train before anything could be done; accordingly, we waited.
The other parcels arrived; the policy of inaction continued. Meanwhile,
several French commercial travellers, who had journeyed hither
by the same train in all the splendor of a spurious parlor-car, chartered
for their sole use, had proceeded around the station, and now attacked
the bolted doors at the front of the baggage-room with furious poundings
and loud bi-lingual ejaculations. But even this had no effect. I
therefore concluded that the object of the "carbineer's" strategy was
a bribe; and, for the first and only time in our journey, I administered
one. Getting him aside, I told him confidentially, with all the animation
proper to an entirely new idea, that we were anxious to get our
belongings examined and passed promptly, so as to secure a resting-place
some time before day, and that we should be greatly obliged if
he would assist us. At the same time I slipped two or three <i>pesetas</i>
into his hand, which he took with the same magnanimous tolerance
he had shown on receiving the cigar. This done, he once more relapsed
into apathy. All known resources had now been exhausted,
and there was nothing to do but wait. With dismay I stood by and
saw my silver follow the cigar, swallowed up in the abyss of official
indifference that yawned before us; and to my companions, who had
just been envying me my slight knowledge of Spanish, and admiring
my tact, I became all at once a perfectly useless object, a specimen of
misguided imbecility&mdash;all owing to the dense unresponsiveness of the
inspector, whose incapacity to act assumed, by contrast with my own
fruitless energy, a resemblance to genius. The oaths and poundings of
the French battalion at the door went on gallantly all the time, but
were quite as ineffectual as my movement on the rear.<a name="page_189" id="page_189"></a></p>

<p>Finally, just when we were reduced to despair, the guard roused
himself from his meditations, rushed to the door, unbolted it to the
impatient assailants, and passed everything in the room without the
slightest examination.</p>

<p>The whole affair remains to this day an enigma; and, as such, one
is forced to accept every trouble of this kind in the Peninsula. But,
as I have said, matters went smoothly enough in other places. Every
important town, I believe, collects its imposts even on articles brought
into market from the surrounding country; and at Seville we paid the
hotel interpreter twenty cents as the nominal duty on our personal belongings.
I have not the slightest doubt that this sum went to swell
his own private revenue; at all events, no such tariff was insisted upon,
or even suggested, elsewhere. The only rule that can be given is to
await the action of customs officials without heat, and, while avoiding
undue eagerness to show that you carry nothing dutiable, hold yourself
in readiness to unlock and exhibit whatever you have. In case a fine
should be exacted, ask for a receipt for the amount; and, if it seems
to be excessive, the American or British consul or commercial agent
may afterward be appealed to.</p>

<p><i>Extra Baggage</i>.&mdash;One point of importance in this connection is generally
overlooked. Only about sixty pounds' weight of luggage is allowed
to each traveller; all trunks are carefully weighed at every station
of departure, and every pound over the above amount is charged
for. Hence, unless a light trunk is selected, and the quantity of personal
effects carefully reduced to the least that is practicable, the expense
of a tour in Spain will be appreciably increased by the item of
extra baggage alone. Baggage of all kinds is registered, and a receipt
given by which it may be identified at the point of destination. It is
important, however, to get to the station at least half an hour before
the time for leaving, since this process of weighing and registering,
like that of selling or stamping tickets, is conducted with extreme deliberation,
and cannot be hastened in any way. On diligence routes
the allowance for baggage is only forty-four pounds (twenty kilograms).
A good precaution, in order to guard against unfair weighing, is to get
one's trunk or trunks properly weighed before starting, and keep a
memorandum of the result.</p>

<p><i>Tickets, etc</i>.&mdash;It is unadvisable to travel in any but first-class carriages
on the Spanish railroads; and the fare for these is somewhat high.
But a very great saving may be made, if the journey be begun from
Paris, by purchasing <i>billets circulaires</i> (circular or round-trip tickets),<a name="page_190" id="page_190"></a>
which&mdash;with a limitation of two months, as to time&mdash;enable the tourist
to go from Paris either to San Sebastian, on the Bay of Biscay, or Barcelona,
on the Mediterranean, and from either of those points to take
in succession all the cities and towns which it is worth while to visit.
A ticket of this kind costs only about ninety dollars, whereas the usual
fare from Paris to Madrid alone is nearly or quite forty dollars. The
<i>billets circulaires</i> may be obtained at a certain central ticket-office in
the Rue St. Honoré, at Paris, to which the inquirer at either of the
great Southern railroads&mdash;that is, the Paris-Lyons and the Orleans
lines&mdash;will be directed. The list of places at which one is permitted
to stop, on this round-trip system, is very extensive, and a coupon
for each part of the route is provided. It must be observed, however,
that when once the trip is begun the holder cannot return upon his
traces, unless a coupon for that purpose be included, without paying
the regular fare. He must continue in the general direction taken at
the start&mdash;entering Spain at one of its northern corners, and coming
out at the opposite northern corner, after having described a sort of
elliptical course through the various points to be visited. And this is,
in fact, the most convenient course to take. It is also prescribed that
at the first frontier station, and at every station from which the holder
afterward starts, he shall show the ticket and have it stamped. Occasionally,
conductors on the trains displayed a tendency to make us pay
something additional; but this was merely an attempt at imposition,
and we always refused to comply. Should the holder of one of these
tickets have a similar experience, and be unable to make the conductor
comprehend, the best thing to do is quietly to persist in not paying,
and, if necessary, have the proper explanation made at the end of the
day's trip.</p>

<p>Journeys by steamer are not included in this arrangement; but we
got our steamer tickets at Malaga remarkably cheap, and in the following
manner: Two boats of rival lines were to start in the same direction
on the same day, and the interpreter, or <i>valet de place</i>, attached to
our <i>fonda</i>, volunteered to take advantage of this circumstance by playing
one company off against the other, and thus beating them down
from the regular price. So he summoned a dim-eyed and dilapidated
man, whilom of the mariners' calling, to act as an intermediary. This
personage was to go to the office of the boat on which we wanted to
embark, and tell them that we thought of sailing by the other line
(which had, in fact, been the case), but that if we could obtain passage
at a price that he named, we would take their steamer; in short, that<a name="page_191" id="page_191"></a>
here was a fine chance of capturing two passengers from the opposition.
The sum which we handed to our dim-eyed emissary was seventy-five
francs; but, while he was absent upon his errand of diplomacy, the interpreter
figured out that we ought to have given him eighteen more,
and we quite commiserated the poor negotiator for having gone off
with an insufficient supply of cash. Imagine our astonishment when he
returned and, instead of asking for the additional amount which we had
counted out all ready for him, laid before us a shining gold piece of
twenty-five francs which he had not expended! Deciding to improve
upon his instructions, he had paid only fifty francs for the two passages.
We certainly were amazed, but the interpreter was still more so; for he
had evidently expected his colleague to say nothing about having saved
the twenty-five francs, but to pocket that and eighteen besides for their
joint credit (or <i>dis</i>credit) account. He controlled his emotions by a
heroic effort; but the complicated play of stupefaction at his agent's
honesty, of bitter chagrin at the loss involved, and of pretended delight
at our remarkable success, was highly interesting to witness. I have
always regretted that some old Italian medallist could not have been
at hand to mould the exquisite conflict of expression which his face
presented at that moment, and render it permanent in a bronze bass-relief.
As it was, we gave each man a bonus of five francs, and then
had paid for our tickets only about half the established rate.</p>

<p><i>Personal Safety</i>.&mdash;Risk of bodily peril from the attacks of bandits, on
the accustomed lines of travel in Spain, need no longer be feared. The
formidable pillagers who once gathered toll along all the highways and
by-ways have been suppressed by the Civil Guards, or military police,
a very trustworthy and thorough organization, which really seems to
be the most (and is, perhaps, the sole) efficient thing about the government
of the kingdom. Of these Guards there are now twenty thousand
foot and five thousand horse distributed throughout the country,
keeping it constantly under patrol, in companies, squads and pairs,
never appearing singly; and where there are only two of them, they
walk twelve paces apart on lonely roads, to avoid simultaneous surprise.
They are armed with rifles, swords, and revolvers, and are drawn from
the pick of the royal army. Some time since there occurred a case in
which two of these men murdered a traveller in a solitary place for
the sake of a few thousand francs he was known to have with him;
but the crime was witnessed by a shepherd lad in concealment, and
they were swiftly brought to trial and executed. This instance is so
exceptional as to make it almost an injustice even to mention it; for,<a name="page_192" id="page_192"></a>
as a rule, perfect dependence may be placed on the Guards, who are
governed by military law and possess a great <i>esprit de corps</i>. A strong
group of them is posted in every city; at every railroad station, no
matter how small, there are two members of the force on duty, and
two more usually accompany each train. The result of all these precautions
is that one may take his seat in a Spanish railroad-carriage
absolutely with less fear of robbery or violence than he might reasonably
feel in England or America. The only instance of banditti pillaging
a railroad-train that is known to have occurred while I was in Spain,
was that of the James brothers in Missouri, whose outrages upon travellers,
in our peaceful and fortunate Republic, were reported to us by
cable, while we were struggling through the imaginary perils of a perfect
police system in a country that knows not the subtleties of American
institutions. And, while we were thus proceeding upon our way,
an atrocious murder was committed in a carriage of the London and
Brighton Railway, which was not the first of its kind to set the English
public shivering with dread and horror.</p>

<p>Even the diligence now appears to be as safe as the rail-carriage.
But it should be clearly understood that, when one goes off the beaten
track and attempts horseback journeys, he exposes himself to quite
other conditions, which it is absurd to expect the police to control.
An acquaintance tells me that he has made excursions of some length
in the saddle, in Spain, meeting nothing but courtesy and good-will;
but he took care to have his pistol-holsters well filled and in plain
sight. To travel on horseback without an armed and trusty native
guide (who should be well paid, and treated with tact and cordiality)
is certainly not the most prudent thing that can be done; but solitary
pedestrianism is mere foolhardiness. A young French journalist of
promise, known to be of good habits, had been loitering alone about
Pamplona a short time before the date of my trip, and was one morning
found murdered outside of the walls. While I was in the South,
too, as I afterward learned, an Englishman, who was concluding a brief
foot-tour in the North, attempted to make his way in the evening
from San Sebastian to Irun, on the frontier: he was captured by bandits,
kept imprisoned for a week in a lonely hut, and doubtless narrowly
missed coming to his death. His own account of his escape gives
a vivid idea of the treatment that may be expected from the rural
population by anybody who gets into a similar predicament.</p>

<p>"I resolved," he says, "to strive for liberty. Having worked out
a stone, which I found rather loose in the wall near me, and having<a name="page_193" id="page_193"></a>
taken advantage of the darkness of my corner, I gnawed asunder the
cord that bound me. I made for the door, which opened into the
other apartment, and there being but one guard left over me&mdash;the
others being off on some expedition&mdash;I watched for an opportunity.
Presently it was afforded me. As the fellow sat with his back toward
me, resting his head upon his hands, I stole forward, holding my stone
in readiness, and with one blow laid him on the floor. Then, snatching
up a knife from the table, I ran out, and after wandering among the
mountains most of the night found myself at daybreak on the high-way,
my feet cut with the stones and my strength gone. I fainted.
On coming round I attempted in vain to rise, when, two men coming
along with a bullock-cart, I asked for help. All they did was to prod
me with their goads and march on. The laborers were now returning
to their work in the fields, and seeing my attempt to regain my feet,
several of them pelted me with clods. I had little strength left, but
at last I managed to get on my feet, and having rested a while to
regain my strength, I staggered along to the town and waited upon
the English vice-consul, who kindly provided me with food and clothes,
after which I accompanied him before the governor of the province,
to make my statement." The Spanish Government do not acknowledge
responsibility for proceedings of this kind on the part of their
people; hence it is doubtful whether in such a case the victim, after
all his peril and suffering, can even recover the value of what has been
stolen from him. But it is perfectly, easy to keep out of the way of
such adventures.</p>

<p>In the Hotel de los Siete Suelos, at Granada, it is true that the
night-porter used to strap around his meagre waist, when he went on
duty, a great swashbuckler's sword, as if some bloody nocturnal incursion
were impending. But whatever the danger was that threatened,
it never befell: the door of the hotel always remained wide open, and
our bellicose porter regularly went to sleep soundly on a bench beside
it, with his weapon dangling ingloriously over his legs. No one ever
seemed to think of using keys for their hotel rooms except in Madrid;
and so far as any likelihood of theft was concerned, this confidence
seemed to be well justified. Many articles that might have roused the
cupidity of unambitious thieves, and could easily have been taken,
were left by my companion and myself lying about our unlocked apartments,
but we sustained no loss.</p>

<p><i>Language</i>.&mdash;One cannot travel to the best advantage in Spain without
having at least a moderate knowledge of French; or, still better,<a name="page_194" id="page_194"></a>
of Spanish. Railroad employés, customs officers, guards, and inn-keepers
there, as a rule, understand only their native tongue. Now
and then one will be found who has command of a very few French
words; but this is quite the exception, and even when it occurs, is not
of much use. At the hotels in all places frequented by foreigners there
are interpreters, who conduct transactions between traveller and landlord,
and act as guides to places of public interest. For services of
this kind they must be paid seven or eight francs a day, certainly not
more, and in the smaller towns less will suffice. These interpreters
always speak a little French; but their English is a decidedly variable
quantity. Of course, people constantly make their way through the
kingdom on the resources of English alone; but it is obvious that in
so doing they must miss a great many opportunities for curious or
instructive observation; and even in viewing the regulation sights the
want of an easy medium of communication will often cause interesting
details to be omitted. The possibility of employing a courier for the
whole journey remains open; but that is a very expensive expedient,
and greatly hampers one's freedom. Enough Spanish for the ordinary
needs of the way can be learned in a month's study, by any one who
has an aptitude for languages. Italian will by no means take the place
of it, although some acquaintance with that language may facilitate the
study of Spanish; the fact being kept in mind, however, that the guttural
character of Spanish is quite alien to the genius of Italian speech,
and comes more naturally to one who knows German. If the tourist
have time enough at his disposal, it is well to take quarters somewhere
in a <i>casa de huespedes</i>, or boarding-house, for two or three weeks, in
order to become familiar with the vernacular.</p>

<p><i>Manners</i>.&mdash;There is a superstition that, if you will only keep taking
off your hat and presenting complimentary cigars, you will meet with
marvels of courteous response, and accomplish nearly everything you
want to, in Spain. But the voyager who relies implicitly on this attractive
theory will often suffer disappointment. It will do no harm
for him to cool his brow by a free indulgence in cap-doffing; and to
make presents of the wretched government cigars commonly in use will
be found a pleasanter task than smoking them. In fact, a failure to
observe these solemn ceremonies places him in the position of a churlish
and disfavored person. But, on the other hand, polite attentions
of this kind are often enough met by a lethargic dignity and inertia
that are far from gratifying. Under such circumstances, let the tourist
remember and apply that prerequisite which I began with mentioning<a name="page_195" id="page_195"></a>&mdash;good-humored
patience. I found my companions by the rail or at
<i>tables d'hóte</i> sometimes considerate and agreeable, at others quite the
reverse, and disposed to ignore the existence of foreigners as something
beneath notice. I remember once, when Velveteen and I, obliged to
change cars, had barely time, before the train was to move again, to
spring into a compartment pointed out by the conductor, we found
there a well-dressed but gross Spaniard, of the wealthy or noble class,
who had had the section marked <i>reservado</i>, and the curtains carefully
drawn. He sprang up from his nap with a snort, and glared angrily
at the intruders, then burst into a storm of rage and expostulation,
most of which he discharged out of window at the conductor: but,
finding that he could get no satisfaction in that way, he subsided into
sullen disdain, paying no attention to my "<i>Buenas dias</i>" ("Good-day"),
and making his dissatisfaction prominent by impatient gestures and
mutterings from time to time. Owing to the cost of baggage transport,
too, the natives generally carry a large number of bundles, bags,
and miniature trunks in the first-class as well as other carriages&mdash;thus
avoiding any fee&mdash;so that it is often difficult to find a place for packages,
or to pass in and out; and those who thus usurp the room are
apt to look with cynical indifference at the perplexities of the latest
comer, whom they leave to shift for himself as well as he can. Nevertheless,
it is an almost universal custom that any one who produces
a lunch during the ride, offers it to all the chance company in the
compartment before partaking of it himself. It is a point of politeness
not to accept such an invitation, but it must be extended just the same
as if this were not the case. In one respect the Spaniards are extremely
polite&mdash;that is, in showing strangers the way from point to point.
Frequently, the first man of whom you inquire how to get back to
your hotel, or elsewhere, will insist upon accompanying you the whole
distance, in order to make sure that you do not go wrong; and this
although it may lie entirely out of his own direction. Such a favor
becomes a very important and desirable one in the tortuous streets of
most Spanish towns.</p>

<p>Among themselves the rule is that all ranks and classes should treat
each other with respect, meeting on terms of a grave but not familiar
equality: hence they expect a similar mode of address from strangers.
When all the conditions are fulfilled, their courtesy is of the magnificent
order&mdash;it is serious, composed, and dignified. Each individual
seems to be living on a pedestal; he bows, or makes a flowing gesture,
and you get an exact idea what it would be like to have the<a name="page_196" id="page_196"></a>
Apollo Belvedere receive you as a host, or a Jupiter Tonans give you
an amicable salutation.</p>

<p>As in America, however, it is usually not easy to get information
from those who are especially hired or appointed to give it. The personal
service of the railroads, with rare exceptions, is ungracious and
careless. One must be sure to ask about all the details he wants to
know, for these are seldom volunteered. There is a main office (called
Despacho Central) in each city, where you may buy tickets, order an
omnibus for the station, make inquiries, etc. At the one in Toledo
I presented our circular tickets for stamping, on departure, and asked
several questions about the train, which showed the agent plainly what
line we were going to take. When we reached Castillejo, I found that,
in spite of all this, he had allowed us to take a road on which the
tickets he had stamped were not valid, and we were forced to pay the
whole fare. Neither will conductors be at the pains to shut the doors
on the sides of the cars; passengers must do this for themselves. I
had travelled all night in a compartment, and in the morning, wishing
to look out, I leaned against the door, and it instantly flew open. As it
was on the off-side when I got in, it was at that time already closed;
but I now discovered that the handle had not even been turned to
secure it. The superficial way in which people do things over there
is seen in the curious little fact that, from the time of leaving France
until that of our return, we could nowhere get the backs of our boots
blacked, though repeatedly insisting on it; the national belief being
that trousers conceal that part of the shoe, and labor given to improving
its appearance would therefore be thrown away.</p>

<p>The demand for fees is in general not so systematic or impudent
as in England; but when one intends to stay more than a day in a
place, better attendance will be obtained by bestowing a present of a
franc or two, although service is included in the regular daily rate of
the hotel. Finally, the Spaniard with whom one comes most in contact
as a tourist is peculiarly averse to being scolded; so that, whatever
the provocation, it is better to deal with him softly.</p>

<p><i>Hotels, Diet, etc</i>.&mdash;The Spanish hotels are conducted on the American
plan; so much a day being paid for room, fare, light, heat, and
service. This sum ranges commonly from $1 50 to $2 00 a head, except
where the very best rooms are supplied. The foreigner, of course,
pays a good deal more than the native, but it is impossible for him to
avoid that. Sometimes coffee after dinner is included in this price, but
coffee after the mid-day breakfast is charged as an extra; and so are<a name="page_197" id="page_197"></a>
all wines except the ordinary red or white Val de Peñas, which are
supplied with both meals. Nothing is furnished before the breakfast
hour excepting a cup of chocolate, some bread, and, possibly, butter.
One should always see his rooms before engaging them, and also be
particular to ask whether the price named includes everything, otherwise
additional items will be foisted upon him when the bill is settled.
Confusion in the account may be avoided by paying for all extras at
the moment of obtaining them.</p>

<p>Those who are unaccustomed to the light provend furnished for
the morning will do well to carry a stock of beef-extract, or something
of the kind. Cow's milk is difficult to get, and such a thing as a boiled
egg with the chocolate is well-nigh unheard of. The national beverage
is the safest: warm chocolate, not very sweet, and so thick that it will
almost hold the spoon upright. Coffee in the morning does not have
the same nutritive force; indeed, quite otherwise than in France and
Germany, it appears to exert in this climate an injurious effect if drunk
early in the day&mdash;at least, a comparison of notes shows it to be so in
summer. Rather more attention should be given to diet in Spain than
in the countries above named, or in England and Italy, owing to peculiarities
of the climate and the cookery. Whoever has not a hardy
digestion runs some danger of disturbance from the all but universal
use of olive-oil in cooking; but, with this exception, the tendency is
more and more toward the adoption of a French <i>cuisine</i> in the best
hotels of the larger cities, and various good, palatable dishes are to
be had in them. The native wines are unadulterated, but strong and
heavy. Owing to something in their composition, or to the unpleasant
taste imparted by the pig-skins, they are to some persons almost poisonous;
so that a degree of caution is necessary in using them. Water
has the reputation of being especially pure in all parts of the kingdom,
and of exercising a beneficial influence on some forms of malady. It
certainly is delicious to drink.</p>

<p>There is much greater cleanliness in the hotels, taking them all in
all, than I had expected; but the want of proper sanitary provision,
omitting the solitary case of the Fonda Suizo at Cordova, where everything
was perfect in this respect, leads to a state of things which may
be described in a word as Oriental&mdash;that is, barbarous in the extreme,
and scarcely endurable. On this point professional guide-writers are
strangely silent. A wise precaution is to carry disinfectants. A small
medicine-case, by-the-way, might with advantage be included in the
equipment proper for travel in the Peninsula.<a name="page_198" id="page_198"></a></p>

<p>We touched the nadir of dirt and unsavoriness, as you may say, in
our first night at the Fonda del Norte, in Burgos; and there the maid
who ushered me to my room warned me, as she retreated, to be careful
about keeping the doors of the anteroom closed because, as she
said, "There are many rats, and if the doors are open they run in here."
But luckily the rest of our experience was an agreeable decline from
this early climax. There is another hotel at Burgos, the Raffaele,
which, as we learned too late, is&mdash;in complete contradiction of the guide-books&mdash;clean
and pleasant. On the practical side, that voyager will
achieve success who plans his route in Spain so as to evade the Fonda
del Norte at Burgos, which is the stronghold of dirt, and the Hotel
de Paris at Madrid, which takes the palm for extortion. Naturally, in
exploring minor towns or villages, one must be prepared to face a good
deal of discomfort, since he must seek shelter at a <i>posada</i> or <i>venta</i>,
where donkeys and other domestic beasts are kept under one roof with
the wayfarer, and perhaps in close proximity to his bed and board.
But among the inns of modern type he will get on fairly well without
having to call out any very great fortitude.</p>

<p><i>Expense of Travel</i>.&mdash;From what has been said about circular tickets
and hotel prices, some notion can be formed as to the general cost of
a Spanish expedition. Housing and transportation should not be
reckoned at less than six dollars a day; and allowance must next be
made for guides, carriages, admission fees, and so on. Altogether, ten
dollars a day may be considered sufficient to cover the strictly necessary
outlay, if the journey be conducted in a comfortable manner; but
it is safer to assume one hundred dollars a week as the probable expense
for one person, and this will leave a margin for the purchase of
characteristic articles here and there&mdash;a piece of lace, a little pottery,
knives, cheap fans, and so on. This estimate is made on the basis of
first-class places <i>en route</i>, and of stops at the best hotels. It could be
materially reduced by choosing second-class hotels, which is by no
means advisable when ladies are of the party; and, even with the better
accommodation, if small rooms be selected and a careful economy
exercised in other directions, sixty dollars a week might be made to
do. To dispense with the aid of the local guides is no saving, if the
design be to move rapidly; because, without such assistance, more
time has to be spent in getting at a given number of objects.</p>

<p><i>Mail-service, Telegrams, Books, etc</i>.&mdash;The mails are conveyed with
promptness and safety, it appears; although at Malaga I observed a
large padlocked and green-painted chest with a narrow aperture in it,<a name="page_199" id="page_199"></a>
lying on the sidewalk in no particular custody, and learned that it was
a convenient movable post-office. Furthermore, it is bewildering to
find, after painfully travelling to the genuine post-office (the <i>Corréo</i>),
that you cannot buy any stamps there. These are kept on sale only
at the shops of tobacconists, whose trade likewise makes them agents
of the governmental monopoly in cigars, cigarettes, etc. The tobacconists'
stores bear the sign <i>Estanco</i> (stamp-shop); and, after one is
accustomed to the plan, it becomes really more convenient to obtain
one's postage from them. To weigh large envelopes or packages, however,
the sender must resort to the <i>Corréo</i>. International postal cards
may be had, which are good between Spain and France, and other
rates are not high. Those who intend to pass rapidly from point to
point will do well to have all correspondence directed to the care of
the American consul or vice-consul&mdash;or, if in Madrid, to the legation
there. There is no difficulty about letters addressed in English, provided
the writing be plain. At the first city which he touches the
tourist should ascertain from the representative of his nationality the
names of all representatives in the other places he expects to go to,
so that he can forward the precise address for each place, and himself
be informed just where to apply for letters or counsel. In cases where
there is no time to take these measures, the plan may be followed of
having letters addressed <i>poste restante</i> at the various points; but they
must then be called for at the post-office, and at each town orders
should be left with the postmaster to forward to some farther objective
point any mail-matter expected at that town, but not received
there. In requesting any service of this kind from consuls, do not
forget to leave with them a proper amount of postage.</p>

<p>Telegrams may be sent from all large places, in English, at rates
about the same as those which prevail elsewhere; but if it is intended
to send many messages by wire, a simple code ought to be arranged
with correspondents beforehand, to save expense. Telegrams have to
be written very carefully, too; I attempted to send one from Granada,
but made a slight correction in one word&mdash;a fact which caused it to be
brought all the way back from the city to my hotel on the Alhambra
hill, with an imperative request that it should be rewritten and returned
free from the least scratch or blot.</p>

<p>Whatever books you may wish to consult on the journey should be
provided at the very start, in America, London, or Paris: ten to one
you will not find them in Spain. It is pleasant, for example, to refer
on the spot to an English version of "Don Quixote," or the French<a name="page_200" id="page_200"></a>
"Gil Blas;" or Prescott's "Ferdinand and Isabella," and the "Columbus,"
the "Conquest of Granada," and "Tales of the Alhambra," by
Irving. Théophile Gautier's "Voyage en Espagne" is another very
delightful hand-mirror in which to see your own observations reflected.
But none of these are obtainable except, possibly, in Madrid and Barcelona;
and even there it is not certain that they will be found. These
two cities are the head-quarters, however, for such Spanish books as
may be required.</p>

<p><i>Bankers and Money</i>.&mdash;Little need be said on this point, beyond suggesting
the usual circular letter of credit, except to forewarn all persons
concerned that they will be charged and must submit to very
heavy commissions and exchange at the houses where their letters entitle
them to draw. Another particular which it is essential to note is
the uncertain currency of certain silver coinage in Spain, and the prevalence
of counterfeit pieces. Strangers must fight shy of any kind of
<i>peseta</i> (equivalent to a franc) except the recent and regulation ones,
though there are many dating from earlier reigns than Alfonso's, which
will pass anywhere. The small money of one province frequently will
not be received in another; and it happened to me to preserve with
great care a Barcelona <i>peseta</i>, which I found unavailable everywhere
else, and had accepted by an oversight in Sevilla, in the confident hope
that I could get rid of it at Barcelona itself; but I discovered that
that was exactly the place where they treated it with the most contempt.
Hence it is best, before leaving one province for another, to
convert your change into gold pieces of twenty-five <i>pesetas</i> worth, or
into silver dollars (which are called <i>duros</i>), worth five <i>pesetas</i> each.</p>

<p>Here, however, let it be noted that the one infallible course to prevent
deception is to ring on some solid surface of wood or stone every
gold or silver coin you receive at the hotel, the banker's, or anywhere
else. If it give a flat sound, no matter what its real value may be,
great trouble will be had in passing it; hence, you must in that case
refuse to take it. For example, a five-dollar piece was given me which
failed to yield the true sound; and though it was perfectly good, having
merely become cracked, I could do nothing with it, even at the
Madrid banker's; finally getting its value in silver, by a mere chance,
from a professional money-changer of more than common enlightenment.</p>

<p>Never give a gold piece to a waiter or any one else to be changed,
unless the transaction is effected under your own eye; for, if he carries
the coin away out of your sight, a substitution will very likely be<a name="page_201" id="page_201"></a>
made, and you cannot then get rid of the uncurrent money which will
be forced upon you. The precaution of ringing or sounding money,
on receipt, is so general that no one need feel any hesitation at practising
it, however it may seem to reflect upon the person who has
proffered the coin. Spanish gold pieces in small quantity may with
advantage be bought in Paris. On the other hand, it is well to carry
more or less Napoleons with you, because French gold is trusted, and
passes with slight discount. The traveller should be provided with
both kinds. Always and persistently refuse Spanish paper.</p>

<p><i>Buying Bric-à-brac, Lace, etc</i>.&mdash;Those who wish to purchase characteristic
products of the country, ancient or modern, need not fear that
opportunity will be wanting; but the most obvious means are not
always the best. The interpreters or guides attached to hotels are
in most places only too anxious to aid in this sort of enterprise;
but it is because they wish to dispose of some private stock of their
own, for which they will surely demand double price. By courteous
but decided treatment they may be led to make most astonishing
reductions from their first demand; and this channel is accordingly,
if properly handled, often as good as any other. Guides in Cordova
will offer an assortment of old hand-made lace, and introduce you to
the silversmiths who there manufacture a peculiarly effective sort of
filigree in ear-rings, shawl-pins, brooches, and other forms. Cordova is
the best place in which to get this kind of ware; but if lace be the
object sought, Sevilla or Barcelona is a much more advantageous market.
Machine-made lace, which is now the favorite kind among Spanish
ladies, and has been brought to a high degree of delicacy, can be
obtained in the greatest variety and on the best terms at Barcelona,
where it is made. Many foreigners, however, prefer the hand-made
kind; and these should explore Sevilla in search of what they wish, for
they can there get it at reasonable prices. In this connection it is to
be premised that the assistance of some personal acquaintance among
the Spaniards themselves, if it can be had, will always effect a considerable
saving; and, when time can be allowed, the best way always is
to make inquiry and prowl around among the stores for one's self.
There are few professed antiquarian and bric-à-brac salesrooms out of
Madrid; but one can often pick up what he wants in out-of-the-way
places. Perhaps the best towns in which to buy the peculiar gay-colored
and ball-fringed <i>mantas</i>, or mantles of the country, and the
equally curious <i>alforjas</i> used by the peasantry, are Granada and Valencia.
In Toledo there is a very peculiar and effective sort of black-and<a name="page_202" id="page_202"></a>-gray
felt blanket, with brilliant embroideries; that city, like the
two just mentioned, being a centre of textile industry. The purchase
of costumes in actual use, from the peasants themselves, which
is something that artists may find useful, can be accomplished after
due bargaining, and by the intervention of the professional interpreter.</p>

<p>The pottery and porcelain of Spain exhibit a great variety of beautiful
shapes, many of them doubtless Moorish in their origin; and some
kinds are invested with a bold, peculiar coloring, dashed on somewhat
in the Limoges style, but very characteristic of the climate and landscape
in which they are produced. The abundance of unusual and
graceful forms constantly suggests the idea of making a collection. I
shall not attempt to specify the localities most favorable for the carrying
out of this idea; because, so far as my own observation went, there
seemed to be material worth investigating almost everywhere. The
common unglazed bottles and jars made and used by the peasantry
in the South, however, are especially attractive, and are met with only
in that part of the country. They are likewise nearly as cheap as the
substance from which they are made. At Granada, too, there is manufactured
a heavy blue-and-white glazed ware, turned with refined and
simple contours, of honest elegance. Formerly barbers' basins moulded
on the Spanish plan&mdash;that is, with a curved piece cut out at one side&mdash;were
made of porcelain; and these may still sometimes be picked up
in Madrid junk-shops or antiquarian lairs. They are not always good
specimens of decorative art, but they are curious and effective. Part
of an extensive collection I saw, which had recently been made by an
American gentleman; and I could imagine that, when hung upon the
wall by his distant fireside across the Atlantic, they would form an interesting
series of trophies&mdash;a row of ceramic scalps, one might say,
marking the fate of so many vanquished dealers.</p>

<p>Old furniture, heavy with carving or marvellously inlaid according
to traditions of the Moors&mdash;monumental pieces, such as were to be seen
in the loan collection of Spanish Art at the South Kensington in 1881,
and are sparsely imported into the United States&mdash;offers larger prizes
to those who search and pay. Many relics of ancient costume, dating
from the period of courtly splendor; rich fabrics; embroideries; sacerdotal
robes and disused altar-cloths; and occasional precious metal-work,
may farther be unearthed in the bric-à-brac shops. With due
care such objects will often be obtained at moderate cost. But it is to
be remembered that the price paid on the spot forms only one item.<a name="page_203" id="page_203"></a>
Transportation to the final shipping-point and the ocean freightage are
very high; amounting in the case of cheap articles to far more than the
original outlay for their purchase.</p>

<p><i>Seasons for Travel</i>.&mdash;A question of very great moment is, what time
of year should be chosen for a sojourn in Spain? The answer to it
depends entirely upon the organization of the person asking, and his
object in going. For a simple trip in search of novelty, the voyager
being of good constitution, it makes little difference. From the first
of June until the first of October the heat, in almost any spot south
of the Pyrenees, will be found severe. From the first of October until
the first of June, severe, cold, treacherous changing winds, snow, and
ice will be encountered, save in a few favored localities hereinafter to
be named, under the head of "Climate for Health." Of the two extremes,
summer is perhaps to be preferred; because the voyager at
that time knows precisely what he has got to prepare for and can meet
it, whereas winter is a more variable emergency. A person of good
constitution, understanding how to take care of himself in either case,
and with an eye to local habits as adapted to the season, may go at
any time. Autumn and spring, however, are obviously the ideal seasons
for a visit. From a comparison of authorities, and from my own
observation of a part of the summer, I should advise going during the
period from October 1 to December 1, or from April 1 to June 1. A
tour involving more than two months' time, of course, must pass these
limits. For hardy and judicious travellers there is no objection to a
sojourn including June and July; although it must be said that sight-seeing
at the South during these months is more in the nature of endurance
than of recreation. I encountered no serious local fever or
other ailment due to hot weather, excepting a kind of cholera referred
to in one of the preceding chapters, called <i>el minuto</i> (the minute),
at Sevilla. By beginning a trip at the southern end of the Peninsula
and gradually working along northward toward France, four months
from March 1 or April 1 could be utilized without any unusual discomfort.</p>

<p><i>Routes</i>.&mdash;The topic just discussed necessarily has a good deal to do
with the selection of a route, which, from the position of the country,
must be made to begin from the North or from the South.</p>

<p>Let us notice, first, the general lines of approach from different
quarters.</p>

<p>From New York direct, for example, one may sail for Cadiz in
steamers of the Anchor and Guion lines, or in the Florio (Spanish)<a name="page_204" id="page_204"></a>
steamers, which last I have heard spoken of in favorable terms by
authority presumably good. From London there are two lines of
steamers: one, Messrs. Hall's, leaving weekly for Lisbon, Gibraltar,
Malaga, and Cadiz; the other, Messrs. MacAndrew's, leaving London
three times a week for Bilbao and the principal ports on the
Mediterranean. For any one wishing to visit Spain alone, these form
the cheapest and nearest means of reaching the country. To go by
steamer from London is, however, very obviously a slower way than
to take the rail from the English capital to Paris and thence to the
frontier, either at Irun and San Sebastian, or at Barcelona by way of
Marseilles and Perpignan. So that, where speed alone is the object,
one may take a fast steamer from New York to Liverpool, use the
rail thence to London, and arrive in Burgos, for instance, about fifty
hours after leaving London. The through train from Paris for Spain
leaves in the evening. Voyagers from the East and Italy, designing
to pass through Spain on their return westward, can embark
on the Peninsular and Oriental steamers, or those of the Messageries
Imperiales.</p>

<p>When one passes through France, on the way, it is possible to buy
a Continental railroad guide, which gives all the trains in Spain and
France, and the connection of one system with the other across the
boundary. This is to be recommended as an exceedingly useful document.</p>

<p>It may as well be remarked here that the information ordinarily
given in books about the coasting steamers from one port to another
along the Mediterranean coast of Spain is as untrustworthy as it is
vague. The precise date of departure from any given town on the
coast for the other ports to the north-east or south-west is not very
easy to ascertain, except in the town itself. One or another steamer,
however, is pretty sure to sail from Cadiz, Malaga, Valencia, and Barcelona
two or three times a week; so that one can scarcely fail of what
the Germans call an "opportunity." There is undoubtedly a difference
in the various lines, as regards comfort and swiftness of progress;
but it is not true, as the guide-books assert, that the French steamers
alone are good, and that the Spanish are dirty and comfortless. We
personally inspected two boats in the harbor of Malaga before making
choice; one was French and the other Spanish, and we found the latter
much the more commodious and cleanly. But, then, it is possible
that some other Spanish line than the one we selected may be inferior
to some still other French line which we did not see. Everybody can<a name="page_205" id="page_205"></a>
satisfy himself, by simply viewing whatever steamers happen to be
on hand for the trip, before engaging passage. The accommodations
on all of them seem to be of a kind that would not be tolerated for a
day in America; but they compare well with those of the best boats
on the English Channel, being fairly on a level with the incomplete
civilization of Europe in respect of convenience, privacy, and hygiene.
The cabins become close and unwholesome at night, and few staterooms
are provided. These last are built to receive from four to six
persons, who may be total strangers to each other; hence, any one
who wishes to be independent of chance comers must betake himself
to the deck at night, or else make special arrangements to secure an
entire room before starting.</p>

<p>Again, on the railroads, many journeys have to be made at night;
and it is seldom that one can secure a sleeping-coach. On much-travelled
lines these are usually bespoken a week in advance. Failing to
get the <i>wagon-lit</i>, as the sleeping-car is called, after the French fashion,
one may sometimes engage a <i>berlina</i>, which is simply the <i>coupé</i> or end
compartment of a car. This, being made to seat three persons instead
of six, is allowed to be reserved. It costs about two dollars for a distance
of one hundred miles.</p>

<p>The route to be followed in any particular case has, in the nature
of things, to be determined by the purpose and circumstances of the
tourist. One may make a geological and mineralogical tour, inspecting
the mountains and the mines of Spain, and find his hands tolerably full
at that; or, one may wend his way to the Peninsula solely to study the
achievements of the former national schools of painting there, in which
case Sevilla and the picture-gallery at Madrid will be his only objective
points&mdash;the latter chief and almost inexhaustible. The architectural
treasures of Spain constitute another source of interest sufficient in
itself for a whole journey and months of study. But those who go
with aims of this sort will find all the advice they need in guides and
special works. What will more probably be sought here is merely an
outline for the wanderer who sets out to obtain general views and impressions
in a brief space of time. Him, then, I advise, if the season
be propitious, to enter Spain from the north, pursue in the main a
straight line to the southern extremity; and then, having made the
excursion to Granada&mdash;which in the present state of the railways must
be a digression from the general circuit&mdash;proceed along the shores of the
Mediterranean toward France again. In this case his trip will arrange
itself in the following order:<a name="page_206" id="page_206"></a></p>

<p>The preceding estimate includes the time to be allowed for going
from place to place; but, as will be seen, the total includes some extra
days occurring in the count where an option is suggested. To accomplish
all that is laid down here in two months, however, would be very
close and hard work; in order to go over the ground comfortably, an
extra week or two should be allowed. The great advantage of entering
the kingdom by way of San Sebastian is that the first impression of
the Pyrenees is much finer there than by way of Perpignan to Gerona
and Barcelona. One also plunges immediately into the heart of ancient
Spain on touching Pamplona and Burgos; and these lead in the
most natural and direct way to Valladolid (the old capital and the
place where "Don Quixote" was written), to Salamanca, Avila, Segovia,
and the Escorial. Furthermore, after Madrid has intervened
between North and South with its mingling of past and present, the
succession of interest follows an ascending scale through Toledo, Cordova,
and Sevilla, culminating at Granada. Next, the Mediterranean
route presents itself as something having a special unity of its own,
with a recurrence to special phases of antiquity again in Zaragoza,
Monserrat, and Gerona. If, on the other hand, we begin with Barcelona
and go southward before coming up to Madrid, we receive a
first impression less striking and characteristic, and also pluck the
most ideal flowers&mdash;Granada, Sevilla, Cordova&mdash;before coming to Madrid.
Taken in the light of such a contrast, Toledo, Avila, Burgos,
and the rest of the northern places will seem less attractive than when<a name="page_207" id="page_207"></a>
grouped together in an introductory glimpse, as a prelude to the more
poetic South.</p>

<p>Supposing, however, that the traveller lands at once in Cadiz, from
the deck of a steamer, he must put all this fine theory aside, and make
the best of the case. His programme will then depend on whether
he proposes to end by going into France, or to return without crossing
the Pyrenees. In the latter event, he might do well to follow the rail
to Sevilla, Cordova, Toledo, and Madrid; then visit the Escorial, Avila,
Segovia, and afterward strike off abruptly to the north-east, through
Zaragoza and Monserrat to Barcelona, coming down the coast again
either by rail or steamer to Valencia, and reserving Granada until near
the end. After Granada, a return to Malaga and a touch at Gibraltar
would deposit him exactly where he started from, at Cadiz.</p>

<p>Should he wish to wind up in France, the situation is more complicated.
He must then take Gibraltar first, come back to Sevilla, go
to Granada, thence to Cordova and Toledo&mdash;omitting Valencia wholly,
unless he be willing to double interminably on his tracks&mdash;pass from
Toledo to Madrid, and then decide whether he will go north-westward
through Avila and Burgos, north-eastward through Zaragoza and Barcelona,
or attempt to embrace both routes by zigzagging across the
widest part of the kingdom.</p>

<p>There remains, finally, the alternative of starting from Cadiz, visiting
Sevilla and Granada, and then, by way of Cordova, Toledo and
Madrid, continuing north to Valladolid, Burgos, and the French frontier,
without troubling the eastern half of the country at all. This
route, after all, includes the most that is best worth seeing, if we leave
out Zaragoza and Monserrat.</p>

<p>Let me add only that nobody should be deterred, by the schedule
given on the preceding page, from making a shorter visit to the Peninsula,
if it come within his range, when circumstances grant him less
time than is there allotted. Even in <i>three</i> weeks a general tour could
be accomplished, allowing several days at Madrid and very brief pauses
at Avila, the Escorial, Toledo, Cordova, Sevilla, Granada, and Barcelona.
So rapid a flight, nevertheless, the voyager must be prepared to find,
will induce a harassing sense that at every point much that it would
be desirable to see has been passed over. But even an outline of actual
experience is sometimes more prized than a complete set of second-hand
impressions.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a <i>single week</i> would suffice the traveller who found
himself on the borders of Spain, to make an excursion which he could<a name="page_208" id="page_208"></a>
hardly regret. Thus from Biarritz one can, in that space of time, cross
the border and run down to Madrid, glance rapidly at the gallery there,
and take the Escorial, Avila, or Burgos&mdash;or possibly two of these&mdash;on
the return. From Marseilles he can visit Gerona, Barcelona, and Monserrat.
Similarly, touching at Cadiz, he can go to Sevilla, Cordova, and
Granada, get a general survey of those places, including the Alhambra
and two of the most beautiful cathedrals in the world, and return to
Cadiz or Malaga, all in seven or eight days. Indeed, one who has it in
his power to reach Granada and spend a day or two there, without attempting
to see anything else, ought not to forego the opportunity.
The sight of the Alhambra alone, and of the enchanting landscape that
surrounds it, may well repay the loss incurred by an inability to make
farther explorations.</p>

<p>All these details in regard to flying trips I submit with due knowledge
that whoever profits by them, at the same time that he admits
himself under obligation for the counsel, will perhaps never forgive
himself for seeing thus much and no more, and may even include in
this unrelenting mood his benevolent adviser.</p>

<p>Enough, I think, has now been said to furnish a basis for all manner
of individual modification. The large anatomical lines, as it were,
have been indicated; and on these each tourist may construct his own
ideal, with any desired curtailment or extension of time to be consumed.</p>

<p><i>Climate for Health</i>&mdash;The resources of Spain as a health resort are,
in general, hardly suspected, much less widely known; and a great
deal has doubtless yet to be done before they can be rendered available.
Still, the existing conditions and favorable circumstances are
worth summarizing in this place. In a singularly careful work on the
winter and spring climates of the Mediterranean shores, Dr. J. H. Bennett,
of England, arrives at some important conclusions respecting the
localities of the Spanish coast. To begin with, the vital distinction
has to be noted that the Peninsula (leaving out the corner abutting
on the Atlantic) possesses two distinct climates: <i>first</i>, that of the central
raised plains stretching from range to range of its several mountain-ribs;
and, <i>second</i>, that of the sea-level and the latitude in which the
country lies. The former is perforce much the colder, and is subject
to raw winds; the latter is mild and uncommonly dry. The health
regions of Spain are confined to the east and south-east coasts, where
the land subsides nearly to the sea-level, and is open to the balmy
influences natural to the latitude. Dr. Bennett observes that the<a name="page_209" id="page_209"></a>
north and north-west winds precipitate their moisture in the mountains
of the central regions of Spain, and that the north-east winds are
drawn down to Algeria by the Desert of Sahara, which creates a sort
of vacuum compelling them southward. As a matter of fact, they do
not molest the eastern coast. Hence, in the words of this physician,
"the eastern coast of Spain is probably the driest region of Europe,
drier even than the Genoese Riviera." Accordingly, Murcia, Alicante,
Valencia, Tarragona, and even Barcelona&mdash;far north though the last-mentioned
is&mdash;all offer extraordinary advantages of climate to the average
run of patients afflicted with chronic chest disease, pulmonary consumption,
chronic bronchitis, bronchitic asthma, chronic diseases of the
kidney, debility and anæmia from any cause, and the failing vitality of
old age. Cadiz, too, possesses a most equable temperature. It is noted,
however, by the writer whom I follow, that the dry air of these places
is injurious in those exceptional cases of chest disease, of nervous
asthma and neuralgia, which are found to be aggravated by a stimulating
atmosphere. Dr. Bennett's theory is that the towns just referred
to lie under a qualifying disadvantage, inasmuch as they stand at some
distance from the mountains, thus permitting the cold winds from the
latter to fall into the plain and sweep the towns to a certain extent.
But in this connection he seems not to remember that in Nice, at least,
the invalid population are now and then scourged by the cold northern
bise rushing down the Rhone to the sea. The most serious objection
to these Spanish towns is the want of comfortable and airy quarters
for invalids. Again, at Malaga, which has been so highly recommended,
the sanitary conditions are such that any benefit from the climate is
likely to be nullified by the evil influences of a want of drainage, and
of latent pestilence.</p>

<p>Here it may be mentioned that the Alhambra hill, at Granada, is
much resorted to by Spaniards in summer as a cool, airy, and healthful
spot; and truly there is none more lovely in its surroundings on the
globe, so far as it is usually permitted man to see. In and about the
Alhambra, too, small cottages may be hired, where the sick and weary
may rest after their own fashion, and keep house for themselves, with
docile native servants. But, whosoever fares to Spain in search of bettered
health, let him not mount the Alhambra hill save in spring, nor
enter the Mediterranean towns until after September. And, above
all, let him avoid the fatal error of supposing that the high regions of
the interior will offer any influences more soothing than those of harsh-tempered
New England.<a name="page_210" id="page_210"></a></p>

<p>This consideration remains, that whatever obstacles to complete
comfort may exist, the perfection of the coast climate, the stimulus of
scenery and surroundings so unique and picturesque, and the resources
of observation or of historic association opened to the sojourner in
Spain are likely to have a good effect, both mental and spiritual.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The dancing boys still officiate at Seville, also, in Holy-week, where they leap merrily
before the high altar, and do not even take off their hats to the Host. The story runs that,
years ago, a visiting bishop from Rome found fault with this as being unorthodox, and threatened
to put a stop to it. He complained to the Pope, and a lenient order issued from the Vatican
that the observance should be discontinued when the boys' clothes should be worn out.
Up to the present day, curiously enough, the clothes have not been worn out.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> These last are called <i>tocas</i>, and are rapidly superseding the long mantilla.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> This characterization, our own experience led us to conclude, was exceedingly unjust.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Some time before this he had, by too adventurous play, received a tossing which laid
him up for eight months, and his death in the ring has since been reported.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> In this connection it is curious to observe that the Toledan peasants, like the Chinese,
confound the letters <i>r</i> and <i>l</i>&mdash;as when they say <i>flol</i> for <i>flor</i>, "flower."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Contained in the series called "The Man with Five Wives."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> A nickname alluding to the sooty black of the clerical costume.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Literally, "sun-trap."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Irving's name heads the ponderous register in which visitors, embracing some of the most
distinguished of the earth, have recorded themselves for fifty years past; and though it is not
generally known, his signature may also be found pencilled on the inner wall of the little mosque
near the Comares Tower, just under the interpolated Spanish choir gallery. Yet there seems
to be a degree of mistiness in the Granadian mind respecting the author of "Tales of the Alhambra."
I think the people sometimes confounded him with the Father of his Country. At
all events, the Hotel Washington Irving is labelled, at one of its entrances, "Hotel Washington,"
as if that were the same thing.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> "Fleming," a name commonly applied to Spanish gypsies; whence it has been inferred
that the first of them came from the Netherlands.</p></div>
